to the lesson on proportional rates multiplying by a constant and tables and show you what it looks like visually this is an exciting lesson because we get to see what it actually any application questions or word problems in this one just lots of graphs to look at on this slide you can see that there is a table over on the left will see a lot of proportional relationships listed like that or you might have some blanks that you have to taking that table of values and then actually graphing it usually the first column here will be your X values those are the ones that move side to side and your second column here we have miles walked would be your Y value so they would move up and down so if I were going to graph these values I would take the number of hours one and I would go over one then I would take miles walked and go up two so I would put a point on the graph right there then I would go to the point two four you can see that right there there would be another point sorry three six and there would be another point there for eight another point there and five ten there would be basically what this creates it creates a line we need to notice a few things about this line that will help us to be able to identify all other proportional relationship graphs moving forward first of all relationships will create a the graph of a straight line the second thing is that important so it has to pass through the origin 0 0 and be a straight line it has to meet both of those requirements and then it is a proportional relationship money kept if you sell t-shirts to t-shirts you raise $1 if you sell 3 t-shirts you raise a dollar 50 for t-shirts you raise two dollars five is 250 and 6 is $3 I guess this fundraiser is not very effective this is a relationship that you can see represented by this arrow and you notice a straight line again and it also passes through the origin this is a proportional relationship so those are examples to try and show you sort of how we could make a non proportional relationship this one here is a graph or played over on on the left and in the right you see the rounds that you get on par so this is a golf I guess so you play three rounds you get two rounds on par nice job play six rounds you get three rounds on par okay play nine rounds we get four rounds on par and we play 12 rounds and you get five rounds look like so we have to ask ourselves a couple of things one is it a straight line well yeah it looks like a straight straight line okay however it does not go through the origin so if through the origin we have to say no this is not a proportional relationship non proportional relationship this one values and correct answers that you get on the test it starts at zero zero if you study for zero hours apparently gonna put a point there then 1 1 so if you study for one hour or you get one correct answer get four correct answers and if you correct answers now you notice when we is not a straight line it does pass straight line which means it is not a proportional relationship proportional relationships need to meet both criteria it needs to go through the origin and be a straight line so again like you to pause the video and to try either draw out this graph or just kind of imagine those points on your screen television monitor or like computer monitor that would get me in a lot of anyway this is a relationship between the arrows that Cavs fires and the and plot those points and then see if it is a proportional relationship three two one go points now and talk about why it is or is not a proportional relationship first off if Kaz fires zero sense if he fires one arrow Kaz is very good Archer then we would graph this and see that yes this is a on the line but it is a straight line so that part is checked off it is a straight line next point does it go through the origin 0 0 does it go through this point down here and yeah it sure does so it goes through the origin example of a proportional relationship on a graph yeah we found one all right practice question number two I want you to graph these points and this one is just labeled x and y go ahead and graph those points check out if it is a proportional relationship go for it all equals 5 y equals two x equals 5 y equals 4 x equals 5 y equals 6 X equals 0 x equals 5 y equals 8 2 4 6 8 good that looks nice all right if I graph these into a line my line would look like this hmm perfectly straight line however it does not go through the origin right for it to be proportional relationship it needs to go through the origin and be a straight line this is not a proportional relationship all right more practice here we go x and y values over there in our table graph them see what you get an relationship all right are we back did you do it did you graph this point 6 2 and this point 2 6 this point six 10 and this point 10 six and graph something that kind of looked come up with that that is certainly not a straight line nor is it through the origin that is absolutely not a proportional relationship sorry not a proportional relationship and you helpful tool it also lets us see visually what a proportional relationship looks like so a couple of just reminders at the end proportional relationships on a graph it must be a straight line it must go through the origin both requirements other and that is proportional

this is 7sp three seventh-grade statistics and probabilities standard three video one mean median and mode this standard said that it would like to informally assess the degree of visual overlap of two numerical data distributions with similar variabilities and it goes on and on and on and before we get into all of that I think finding the average would be important and that would fall in line with this idea called like you to know about the median and you to know please jot these down in your journals and define them okay it this data so these are three different ways that we can find the middle point or the average of these particular numbers and the numbers might represent temperature outside I guess there are eight numbers so maybe the last eight this in terms of temperature alright so the mean or the average is the sum of the values divided by the number of the values okay so to find the mean or the average basically we are going to add all of the inputs together and then we are going to divide that total whatever that total is divided by the number of double-check one two three four five six calculator the right so we have 64 60 64 38 50 to 65 60 1 and 48 make sure we got them all on the line here that is going to equal a total of 452 so we have 452 divided by 8 inputs gets us what do we have 50 6.5 and if we were dealing with temperature we could put degrees on there whatever we were calculating in terms of this particular data okay so 56.5 56 and a half final answer okay the median is a little different in the median it says the middle value this median is the middle value when they are written in numerical order or number in number order from left to right it looks like the smallest number is 38 and then we have looks like 48 is next 52 them both down 64 and 64 here and here and then we have 65 okay now we need to find the middle value so I usually take my fingers my left finger and my right finger and I start working my way with two pens at the same time here but working your way toward the center I can eliminate the 38 in the 65 moving on down the 48 and the 64 cancel each other the 52 and the next 64 cancel and it looks like we are left with two numbers in the middle and if it has two numbers numbers in the middle we have to find the mean of those two middle values so point between that 60 and 61 now a couple ways you could do that you could add them up and divide by two because the mean so 60 plus 60 1 divided by 2 or just think of since the numbers are pretty close to each other what is the halfway point between 60 and 61 well the halfway point would be 60 and a half that would be your final answer values so if these were the two values 61 find the mean which means divided by 121 121 divided by 2 and there it is you get the same answer of 60 and a half alright the last way of finding the average or the middle or some type of occurrence between your pieces of D data to see if they have any type of relationship to each other and now the mode is the value that occurs most often it could have no mode 1 mode gonna go through each of those situations for you okay so the one that occurs the most often or in other words the one or ones that occur more times than the others now is there any number in here that that is the case do we have a number or numbers that occur more than the others and it is we have 64 so 64 occurs once and twice and two times is more than the others because the others all occur one time so the mode is equal to 64 all right so in this case we have what was that one it can have none so this one has one particular mode all right I chose some new values here because I wanted to show you the other cases or the other possibilities that have a 6 and a 6 so these occur two times we have an eight and an eight two times a 10 a 14 so those all occur so a 4 the 10 the 14 and the 15 all occur one time but these numbers over here the 6 and the 8 occur more than they do so more times than the others and since two modes so the modes are 6 a situation where I have the four occurring twice the six occurring twice the eight is occurring twice and the ten is occurring twice which means there more times than the other they all occur the same amount of times in this case three times you know let me draw that out there maybe there was a for another six another eight and another ten and just changed these into ugly threes for they occur three times maybe they could all occur four times but if they all occur the same amount of times which is more than the others there is no mode here they all occur the than the others so there is no mode here and you would just write that down no mode okay in given terms on page two of the flip chart write a few sentences on what you learned from

this lesson you will learn how to convert rational numbers that are written as fractions into decimals just remember a little bit about rational numbers recall that a rational number is a number that can be written as a fraction in the form P over Q where both P and Q are integers and Q is nonzero now this rational number can be expressed as a decimal and there are two different outcomes for rational numbers when it comes to decimals the first outcome is that you get a terminating decimal and the other outcome is that you get a repeating decimal for a terminating decimal you have a fixed number of digits so notice here that after the digit six the number does not continue on and this is a good example of a terminating decimal now a repeating decimal does not end at a fixed number of decimal places instead it has a repeating pattern of digits or a sequence of digits that continue on forever after the decimal point so an example here you have the number twenty three point two two two two and this would continue on forever and you can symbolize this by putting a bar over the have right here and this means that the digit two will repeat forever for an infinite number of decimal places and you have the digits five four in this sequence repeating over and over again and here you put the bar over the sequence that repeats to let the viewer of this number know that 54 will continue on forever after the decimal place now there are other numbers that are non terminating but have no repeating number and these are irrational an example of an irrational number is given here so you have five point three one six seven eight nine one four two da-da-da this would continue for an infinite number of decimal places but there will be no repeating pattern other type of example you hear is the square root of a non perfect square so two is not a perfect square when you take the square root of this number you get a non-repeating nonterminating decimal of one point four one two 135 6 . this could go on forever so now that difference between irrational and problems Elizabeth has four thirds of a pie her friend Michelle wants five tenths of the pie or 0.5 how much pie will Elizabeth have leftover if she give Michelle all of the Chi wants so left can be found using subtraction so you have this is a total amount four thirds and subtract away the amount that Michelle wants which is zero point five subtraction unless both numbers are written as fractions or both written as fraction here into a decimal now recall that a rational number has the form P over Q where Q is not zero so Q does not equal zero so what I notice is that 4/3 is a rational number and in that case I can divide the numerator by the denominator the fraction symbol is just another way of expressing the division of the numerator by the denominator so is the divisor and four is the dividend so how many times does 3 go into fourth 3 goes into 4 one time one times three is three so now you subtract 4 minus 3 is 1 and now you want to divide 3 into greater than 1 so what you need to do is add a decimal point here and also put one above now throw in a zero bring the zero down and ask yourself now how many times is 3 go into 10 three goes into 10 three little bit longer to keep going 3 goes in 3 times 3 times 3 is 9 and now do the subtraction 10 minus 9 is 1 3 does not to include another zero bring that zero all the way down here 3 goes into 10 three times 3 times 3 is 9 and you can subtract again you get 10 minus 9 is 1 to include a zero bring it all the way down to here and now 3 goes into 10 three times and you could keep doing pattern for me every time I get uh I left with one and I have to include another zero and so what you get is that these digits after the decimal point are going to repeat now that I have the decimal for the fraction we can do the you know these are gonna repeat forever going to do here is include a bunch of gonna have decimal places that we need to subtract now 0.5 0 0 0 0 is the same subtract 3 minus 0 you get 3 3 minus 0 3 3 minus 0 3 3 minus 0 10 3 and then you get to this point you have 3 minus 5 so what you need to do is break the 1 and when you do that you break the 1 into tenths so you get 10 tenths which means now you have 13 tenths over here now subtract 13 tenths minus 5 tenths leaves you with 8 tenths in that place now you have a 0 in the ones place a 0 minus 0 is 0 so after you do a subtraction or after Elizabeth gives her friend Michelle some pie Elizabeth will be left with zero point 8 3 3 3 3 and this would up with this much pie in this problem you want to convert 14 fits into a decimal to convert a fraction into a decimal divide the numerator by the denominator once you start dividing you can see if the quotient or the decimal which is what it will be repeats or terminates so divide this your divisor is 5 the denominator is always a divisor so you have 5 needs a thicker pen you 5 divide it into 14 so how many times this times 5 is 10 and when you subtract 14 smaller so what you need to do is put a decimal point here and above and then include some zeros so now bring this 0 down and ask yourself how many times does 5 go into 40 well 5 times 8 is 40 is 40 and now you go to do the subtraction and you get a remainder of 0 that means that the fraction 14 fifths can be expressed as a decimal as 2.8 in this lesson you have learned how to convert fractions into decimals thanks for watching ',91,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,Yes

seventh-graders welcome back and constant of proportionality so our find the constant of proportionality from a word problem table and a graph so the constant proportion proportionality is how much a rate changes how much the rate change is it K the unit rate so the constant of proportionality is the same thing as a since in sixth grade and so far this really hard on finding the unary constant of proportionality is the same because we are going to figure out examples in a graph in a table and in word problems okay so in a word problem me how we can do this this one should be review for sure so if Emily can read 7680 words in one hour which is 60 minutes read in one unit or in one minute so in different colors you can circle one units so 7680 words we want to figure out in one unit okay so one unit we trying to figure it out many words can she read in one minute okay so it gives us one hour but we want to use the 60 minutes because we want to know the unit rate so when we set up for proportion you label please make sure you label this is going to help you a time so 7680 trying to find the unit rate so we want to know how many words so how many words can we read or can this person can Emily read in one minute right here so how many words so we need to cross multiply so seven thousand six hundred and eighty times one six hundred and eighty times one equals and then we got to the other side sixty times X so 706 sorry 7680 there we go seven huh six hundred and eighty equals sixty X already get X all by itself we need to multiplying to get that sixty away from the X we need to divide by 60 okay and remember we can use our calculators on calculator we would go seven thousand six hundred and eighty divided by sixty is equal to a hundred and twenty eight okay here X is on the same level as 7680 words so we know that Emily can read 128 words per minute okay and then what what constant of proportionality is braces can you make per yard of court so proportion know you can pick any of these rows to set up your proportion with I like to do the first one just and division easier in the long run so two well for every 12 bracelets very 12 bracelets and it gave us B for bracelets so for every 12 B we are making having meaning in three yards of cord 3c okay per yard of cord so per yard remember per yard means just one so one C and we bracelets can we make for one yard okay now this looks awfully familiar so this is 12 this rate to every 12 braces we need 3 yards of cord we set up our this missing number so when we cross multiply you got 12 times one equals and clean it 12 times 1 is 12 equals 3 me get that beat all by itself so we get divided by B by itself when you divide by 3 so B is equal to 4 because 12 divided by 3 is 4 so what does B stand for well we know that for every one yards over for bracelets B means bracelets for every four bracelets you need one yard of cord you need one yard of court last example is looking at a graph so but I do want you to write down this part over here for every point you can see clearly find a point you can see clearly to find your exact numbers set up a proportion to find that constant of proportion of unit rate you need to set think it will here when you see the example so you are we are trying to find a point on the line that we can clearly write down my our equation our rate so the one that I jumps out of me is right here okay and that point remember we go X Y so X is 10 so that we can clearly see with both X X and the y axis it goes right on a point that we can see okay so now when we have this to go 10 over 20 that is where as we need to find that make X equal to one we need to make X trying to find the x is 1 okay and we proportion again 10 y is equal to 20 that back here so you have 10 over 20 equals 1 over Y all right we have 10 y is equal to 20 times 1 okay there we go so 10 Y is equal to 20 now we need to get Y all by itself so to do that we need to divide by 10 all right so y to so the rate of proportion is the ordered pair which XY 1 2 so for every one seed packet because stands for okay so with that I want you of this in class I just wanted to give you an introduction of it so

7ee - this is seventh-grade expressions and equations - video one rewriting linear expressions and I want to touch a little bit on the standard right here we are going to take these linear expressions rewrite them in a context that would be able to shed a little bit more light on the problem and how these quantities that are in it are double check our notes and make sure that we have these terms written down a little bit with combining like terms so following some order of operations combining like terms and then finding out whether or not these two expressions are equal to each other expression one it says ten times the quantity of Forex subtracted by 5x is that equivalent or equal to expression two which is already using our multiplication first we have ten times 4x would be 40 X and then we are subtracting 5x + 40 X minus 5x is equal to 35 X so is expression 1 equivalent to expression - yes they are equal and it says if so explain how you determine your answer well I was able to use my order of operations combined my notice that we have equivalent please pause the video and see if these back here it says two-fifths x 4x a little bit more work to do let me fraction where it going so we have 2/5 times 4x and that would be 4x we could the value it still means 4 X so 2 times 4x is equal to 8x over 5 subtracted by 3/10 X and now we need a common denominator to make sure that we can subtract these fractions so the common denominator a 5 and 10 would have to be leave it as 3/10 X all right so how do we get from a five to a 10 while we 13 tenths X is that the same as 13 X well if I were to simplify 13 over 10 we would divide the numerator by the denominator and we would get 1.3 x so the same place value I have a whole number 13.0 and I have a decimal mixed number here of 1 and 3 tenths X so these are not equivalent they look kind of the this is basically what this standard is all about it says two different clients are bidding on the same house client number two bids 8% more than client number one the expression x + 8 hundredths X can be used to determine the amount that a client number to bid write an expression that is equivalent to the given expression and explain how it might be more helpful in determining the amount that client number 2 bit that number in the paragraph but I just created one and you can do that with word problems try to create something that some numbers that you can use to have a problem make sense alright so client number one I said they really really really liked that house and they want it and then along comes client number two this person also gonna have a bidding war and if client number one says I want that house for $200,000 the second be client numbers once $200,000 and client number two so this is client of its so 8% of $200,000 is a multiplication problem of means multiply alright so here is your set up expression client number one was their bid called of client number one switch was X and we have this expression that has multiple values for X so if I were to simplify this and make this easier I could make this a 1x added to a 800th X and if we combined our like terms like we did on the last couple screens I would have 1 and 8 hundredths X okay so would it be easier to take the purple line and and do the multiplication of 8% and add on the $200,000 to it or can I just take the one at eight hundredths X and replace the X with the two hundred thousand two hundred thousand dollars so in determining that this one is going to be a lot easier to manipulate or use than the purple line right here okay now if you wanted to solve that out we could get out a calculator and multiply two hundred thousand dollars right now that is sixteen thousand dollars so client number to actually bid sixteen thousand dollars more than client number one all right now the last part of this says write the expression and then explain how it might be more helpful in determining the amounts all right so I wrote a little paragraph down here for you it says this expression one point now one in eight hundredths X this expression makes it easier to calculate the amount that client number two bid because I simply have to multiply the amount that client number one bid by one and eight hundred to determine the amounts of the just taking this entire line the purple line out of the out of your thoughts and just combining your like terms in the expression and multiplying it by your $200,000 which is your X your starting value from client 1 Wow we will take this in class and definitely explain this further this is the main part of the standard that I really want you to grasp all right the last few slides on going to practice again reading a graph or reading pictures in this case we have a perimeter problem in determining your what expressions can be built and then what one would be the easiest to use all right rectangle we have two values of your side lengths we have a width called W and then in the problem it says we have the width which is 6 inches longer so the length is 6 inches longer than perimeter we know that the perimeter is equal to the sum of all of the sides some adding up of all sides okay now if I were to just write that out completely the perimeter is equal to your with over here added to we have this W plus 6 another length and there are your our sides that is a very long expression so if I were to know what the width is equal to what I want to take that width and plug it in all of these spaces or can I combine my like terms and use this simplified expression okay so the perimeter should be equal to one with two three four widths W plus one W plus one W is equal to four we have a six plus six which is equal to a plus or positive twelve I personally would like to use the second expression even though they would both work it just seems like the second expression would be an easier one to work with all right last one it says rewrite this expression in two different ways so it looks like we are going to be expanding this expression talked about expanding expressions that this all right the first way is your basic distributive property so we take six and multiply it by 1/2 X well 6 fraction work some of you might already know that answer but 6 times 1/2 X and then we have 6 x 3y which is a different variable that would get you here and then the last one would get you 6 x a negative 8 okay so we would expression number one could look like well 6 times 1 is 6 over 2 which is a 3 so we have 3x plus 18 Y minus 48 if you just follow all of your operations down the line we can combine this now and see how it positive 18 wise positive times positive and then we have 6 times negative is a negative 48 so there is one way that we can rewrite this expression and then the second way I guess we could just set them up as all fractions how about 6 over 2 X plus 3 over no hang on a second as 6 times 3 hey give me that pen plus 6 times 3y and then we can do minus 6 times y or 8 all right so all I did what there was I used my distributive property I just wrote it out okay so here are your two different ways of writing this many other forms that these expressions class also all right in your journal I would like you to define the given terms on page 2 that in a previous video write a few sentences on what you learned and write some questions down this was a pretty intense video a lot to this standard when it comes to combining your like terms and applying it to that real-world problem with a bidding war and I will see you in

about solving equations in one-step with two steps with some about what this means when we have is instead of getting sort of one something and I know it sounds confusing understanding of what that means okay mathematical sentence form by placing an inequality symbol between two expressions okay so an inequality symbol is gonna be something that is not equal equal though so if we have something those are two equivalent expressions okay we have 4 and 1 and we have 5 and they say the same thing if I go up 4 and those would be equal okay and so in any these symbols okay this first one is we have the greater than symbol and then becomes less than or equal to and then we have greater than or equal to and then we have an equal sign with a line through it which means not equal to okay and the way we always read these as as you look at them you look from left to left side will be less than whatever is on the right side so for instance we could say we know that for instance 4 is and then conversely right on the opposite way if we use the greater than and I could say well 5 is greater than 4 okay and we could say 5 is greater than 3 5 is greater than 2 5 is greater than 1 is bigger than okay so there are some of those there we have the symbols and I would hope they you write this down write the definition down and then also write down each of these symbols so you might want to pause it before I move on here is when we when we have solutions to these okay like I said before there can substitute in for a variable to make an inequality true and this is gonna make a little more sense as we move on here okay remember a variable is in changeable thing that represents an idea or a situation all right well then we also have this thing called the graph of about using a number line then using you see you later okay so the graph of an inequality with 1 we only talk about one variable is a set of points on a number line that represents the solution to the okay well here we go I have an inequality here I have X is greater than 0 all right but X is really a number we how we read this is we look at this we say okay all numbers greater than 0 and describing positive numbers right if I was describing what are positive numbers well positive numbers are any numbers the what I would do to show this is I would go ahead and I would I would say any number greater than that ok so shade in any number greater than that arrow at the end to indicate that it right every number above this right so of those numbers are greater than zero okay which numbers are greater than zero and this is how we show it we know that one is bigger than zero we know that two is bigger than zero three four five right any positive number is gonna be well why did he write an open circle zero is not greater than zero in fact including it okay so you can think of zero is the beginning of it not being true okay this is not part of the answer but anything bigger than that and the reason why I fill in every number in between here is because any positive number could also be a decimal right we could have all kinds of decimals in here I could say one point eight right well one point eight goes in here about and one point eight is that greater than zero yes it is greater than zero I could say one point one okay and that number goes in right about here somewhere and I could say is that greater than zero yes it is okay so what we need to do is we need to talk about all of those decimals well I could talk about some of these fractions right I could say one-fourth okay one-fourth comes in right about and there somewhere is that greater than zero but it is okay I could say one zero so I could keep doing that over and over and over again and really what uh-huh and here we have another one all numbers that are less than two okay so once you to graph one on the number line okay go ahead said okay well which numbers on a number line are gonna be less than two right so if we start at two we can put a circle circle because if I put in two all right look here if I look at three is three lower than to know is four lower than two no in fact all the numbers on this side are not lower than two what about over here what about one is one lower than two yes how about zero yes negative one and all of these what about all these numbers that are in decimals like 1.5 or 1.6 or 1.7 are they all lower gonna go all the way this way and then say are you gonna keep going on and on like okay so all of these three things are all saying the same thing okay so you to give me if I give you the to give me a graph or if I give you the words are you gonna be able to give me the graph and the mathematical expression or if I give you the graph are you gonna be able to give me the and try this one if I give you X is less than or equal to negative one which means all numbers that are less than or equal to one negative one go ahead and try this one okay well looking at this one now I have this or equal to sign okay which says instead of have a closed circle because negative one is now part of the solution okay because negative one is it lower than negative 1 no but it could be equal to and that than or equal to negative one all right less than negative 1 so late a lot of times it might be easier just to pick a positive number and then look at it this one is one less then what about if we do negative 2 is negative 2 less than negative 1 it is this way all right so my suggestion would be always pick a couple like one or two numbers on either side a positive and a negative and see and test it to you go ahead and you try graphing this one go all right look awfully had a looking at numbers that are greater than negative 2 yes it is what about 2 was to more than negative 2 yeah what about 4 is 4 more than negative 2 yes it is so line heading to the right all the numbers that are greater than this okay look at this we could say negative 3 is okay and now what you might want to do until just a second is you know think about we can use our vertical number lines again okay you can look at this and say 0 negative 1 negative 2 negative 3 and we can look at the 1 & 2 and we can count up and down here and we can say do these numbers does this does this work okay and you look at this say great greater than well that means up okay numbers that are greater than that all right and then on this other one here if we look at this one okay go up and down we can say 0 and negative 1 and negative 2 and 1 & 2 and we can say numbers that are less negative 1 and less than means down ok another way of doing it okay what I want you to do here is I want you to try to give me the mathematical statement okay you pause the video and try these two go gonna be greater than where are we numbers that are greater than or equal to negative one okay all numbers greater than or equal to negative one all right this is an empty hole so the word to are all numbers greater than two okay how you do all right last one here so we gonna be less than negative one open than negative one okay and this last one filled in so it could be equal to so than or equal to two okay sort of talk about some situations where in real life where you encounter something with an inequality and then I want you to try to come up with you want to view these on your own that you can describe an inequality which a lot of the eighth graders will experience this coming up after Great America and you want to ride a ride well there are height restrictions height H needs to be greater than or equal to 48 inches all right that would be an inequality okay this situation is represented by an this is talking about this is how you might use an inequality because you could be 49 inches you could be 48 on the dot you could be 48 point one you could be 78 inches right as long as you meet that the bottom of that line or okay talk more about this class tomorrow

absolute value and additive inverses things around the number looks like two lines on either side of it I can see itself absolute value right here and absolute value we always want to look for wherever we are on a number line and how many spaces it takes to get back to zero I like to say how many jumps it takes to get from wherever we are a positive value or negative value back to the absolute value of negative three if I was at negative three on my number line I would be right here now how many jumps does it take to get back to the origin back to zero well it takes one two three how about another example a positive number inside of absolute value brackets this positive number line and I want to know how many jumps it takes to get back to the origin well it takes two jumps to get back to the origin so we would say that positive two hours our answer or we know it as negative eight plus five and the way that I want to look at this this goes back to understanding our integer rules is that I have inside here I am eight negatives and the way that I portray negative face above it and if I have negatives and five positives what do I have more of yeah if these give these more negatives how many more negatives have three more negatives than I do positives and so now what we really want to find is what is the absolute value of combine terms and make sure that we simplify it down to one integer and then we can find the absolute value of that if I am at negative three well that puts us back to what we started with at the beginning and I know that that is three jumps back to the origin just like we did over here and so the absolute value of negative three is just going to be positive three and what I like to say is ahead and make it an expression I have one negative inside of my absolute value brackets and I also have two negatives inside of my absolute value brackets and if these guys are all do we have well we have three of them so inside of my absolute value brackets the absolute value of negative three that a couple of times so when that comes out I have three jumps but the problem is I still have this negative sign on the outside and when I have a negative sign on the outside of the absolute value bracket it then makes our number of jumps into a negative answer so when we have the absolute value of negative one minus two we get negative three and we take the absolute value of that we get three but the minus sign that was outside follows down to our answer making our answer negative this is probably one of the most difficult ones continue with additive inverses additive inverses are perfect opposites and what it is is two numbers that make zero off with a number that has no sign in front of it like the number eight is it so the additive inverse to an eight what number would we combine with a in order to makes zero will it be negative eight eight minus eight is equal to zero but what they really want you to know is if watch what we get we get eight plus a negative eight and that does equal zero because what we have to understand is and if you put these two terms together and we use my positive and negative also have eight negatives well if you have the same amount in the room really they cancel each other out and we have an expression with more than two terms two negatives now what we can understand is if we put all these people in a room of the room and all the positives on the other well my negatives if they were gonna go here how many negatives would I have altogether we move them to the left side of the room well I started with three and I have two more so that gives me five negatives if we then put the positives on the right side of the room all right and how we can take a look at what we have more of but wait a second positives I have exactly the same amount of both positives than negatives and there are any more negatives than positives which the two they cancel each other out and form zero so what happens when we take additive inverses and absolute value and going on gonna stick with figuring out what type negatives and I also have four negatives and so if all of those are in a room together that means I have a total of seven negatives in the room okay now what do I still have on the outside of the absolute value brackets I still have a seven and I still have a minus sign so what we want to focus in on is what is the absolute value of negative seven if I was on a number line how many jumps would it take to get back to our origin would take seven jumps which means the absolute value of negative seven is seven but again what do I still have on the outside of those absolute value brackets that I need to bring down I have a positive seven and I have a minus sign and now here is where people make what type of integer we have in both situations negative phases the first one I have seven positives in the second term it means I have seven negatives here if we put them all in a room together is there any difference between how many positives we have compared to how many more positives than we do negatives which means that these two numbers are zero

working on this kind of rotation I gonna do six examples so you need to folded your paper into six pieces so hold it hot dog style and then into problems together and then on the back of there you can show your work for your the grade book and the goformative help you practice over the next two days so we are not really trying something the year with unit one and we did adding and subtracting and multiplying and dividing rational numbers but just do more real-world problems so the first example we have is Taylor had a balance of negative twenty four dollars and fifty five cents in her bank account she needed to make a deposit so she could requirement of $50 how much does she like this we know that she has negative twenty four dollars and fifty five cents we know she needs fifty dollars and to get from here to here if you remember from the first unit this is kind of one of those absolute value problems so what the negative twenty-four fifty-five so that you can see that remember when we have this subtracting a negative we can rewrite this as 50 plus twenty four 55 which will then mean she needs to deposit seventy four dollars and fifty five cents into her bank account in order to reach that fifty dollar balance this is why when we started this we talked so much about a number line because modeling in our number line helps make us make sense of why we subtract a negative and why we turn that really going from 24:55 to zero and then from zero to example we are gonna do another kind of bank account balance it says any had a balance of forty five dollars and fifty five cents and she spent seventy dollars and 85 cents what was the balance in her 4550 that she had in her bank account so notice when I wrote this do you have more positive values or more negative values and you have more negatives so we know at the very end of this our answer is gonna be something negative because we know we have more negatives and I have been telling you would set this up over to the side and do my subtraction over here line up all my decimal places because you cannot use a calculator for this and I would do my any of those careless errors and you have all of everything lined up so when we do our subtraction we get 25 dollars and 30 cents but remember like I had cents because she spent more money than she had in her account okay so here is our third example this one is about a gears here so the submarine is navigating at a depth of 35 and 1/3 kilometers and if we think about a represent that 35 and 1/3 and then it says it ascends nine and five six kilometers into the ocean that means ascend means to increase or go up so we are gonna have a positive nine and five six so going back to what we said before in that previous problem we have opposite signs we have negatives or positives we have more negative values have a negative as our final answer of the new depth so once again I would set kind of my subtraction up to the side two sixths plus nine and five sixths but the side 35 and 2/6 takeaway nine and sixths and five six and get a positive into 34 and take one whole and add it to this so this is really gonna be eight sixths so eight six take away five six is three get negative 25 and three sixths and we can even simplify that to negative 25 next example another kind of up or down situation with a sequel so the sequel is flying at an elevation of 12 and 3/4 sea level and then it descends 17 and one-sixth feet so like before us and meant to go up descend means to go down so we are gonna model this as a negative so 12 and 3/4 subtract 17 and 1/6 so common denominator 12 and 3/4 is gonna become 12 n 9 12 subtract 17 and 2 12 subtraction up over here to the side my subtraction I just want to make sure that I line up all the things that I twelfths and 9 twelfths and get a turn this into 14 12 because they really just took one whole here and I added it to this fraction to make my subtraction easier so 14 12 minus 9 12 would be 5 12 16 minus 12 would be 4 so we end up here with 4 & 5 12 now did you catch what I forgot to do that I did in the previous problems look back at the problem 12 and 3/4 minus 17 and 1/6 do i have more positive values or more negative values should my answer be positive or should my answer be negative in this case we had more negative so now we know that the seagull has dove into the water to catch this fish so negative 4 & 5 twelfths feet or 4 & 5 twelfths feet below sea level all gears the ones we did previously were a gonna get into the multiplying and the dividing for our rational numbers in a word problem so it says profits at a negative by 1015 dollars and 28 cents in one week what was the average change in profit per day so in one week we know by those 7 days so if we think back to our rules we have one positive value and one negative which is an odd number of negatives so we know that at the end of money each day each day of the week so whatever our answer is gonna be has to be negative so when we do our dividing we can set up our long division like I any decimals out here so you can just kind of place our decimal here we know 7 have 3 remaining and 7 goes into 31 4 times which would be 20 again we have three remaining this time we have a 35 7 goes into 35 perfectly five times so this time we have no remainders and if you check this out we know seven goes into 28 four times so we actually get 0 for the 2 & 4 over the 8 because something goes into 28 4 times so when we do our division it dydz perfectly with no remainders for 145 dollars and four cents each day it is decreasing by that value each day you could go back and double-check this by doing seven good to go and you got the right answer always kind of try that where you divide or multiply to check your answers all right last one this one is talking about the temperature it changes by three point two degrees every hour for four hours so that means we are going to multiply negative three point two multiplied by four we have one negative like I said before so we know our answer is gonna be negative negative twelve point eight degrees to be exact this one was pretty straightforward just multiply

18 Q + 30 okay so a lot of students are asking well mr. answer actually this is it the one 6 and we have shown that we have reduced the inside of our parentheses down to 3 q + 5 here we go this is a factoring question that came up that a student had a question on so I wrote it down to explain to you guys he got a little bit stuck because when he find five and fifteen and I think it was because he was overlooking the fact that we can divide by the same number five can go into 5 one time and five can go into 15 three times so what actually can be factored out of this expression is the number five what are we multiplying by now well 5 goes into 5 once we see it in our jump count so I can write down one C and 5 goes into 15 we see on our jump count three times if we needed help with division but this division seems pretty easy when go ahead and put that plus sign in there the one in front of the C we could just put down the letter C and because that we only have one of them both of these ladies and gentlemen are correctly written say that again we absolutely can use the commutative property for the or so if I wanted to continue commutative property would allow me to keep five outside the parentheses and since we have addition I could put the three first in the C second and it would still give us a correct answer 5 times 3 is 15 five times C is 5 C so the expression would still be the same great question it got a little interesting when we got further along in the lesson and all of a sudden two variable terms came up and they were doing they just want to make sure they were correct thirty and forty are both in the column where ten is ten can divide into thirty three times ten can divide into forty four times and all we wanted to make sure that we were doing is that we were only pulling out ten from this expression ten is what we multiply by so what did we write and how did we simplify the terms inside the parentheses well it was very simple we just needed to make sure we kept the variables with them ten goes into thirty three times so this is actually three q 10 goes into forty four times so we keep be put together to simplify more no because there are two different variables so all we do is we put the plus sign in between them to show that we want to combine them if possible but factored expression 10 times 3 Q plus 4 R is going to be correct ',554,18,8,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Yes

is probabilistic a trial or an experiment a sample space is just all of outcomes so a very simple trial might be coin a coin flip well then the sample space is going to be the set of all the possible outcomes so you could get a heads or you could you could get a tails that right over here is the sample space useful because in for example if these are equally likely outcomes then and you of the event of a heads you say ok outcomes or you can even construct it once you know all the possible outcomes probability distribution we at least know what the sample space is we know think about the probability of each of those outcomes but a lot of times when often there they tend to be most useful I would say when you have equally likely outcomes and like in the case of a fair coin flip because then from the sample think about the probability of various events but this is a simple sample space bakery there are three types three three different sizes of cupcakes so now different ways in which that the thing this down so we have our flavors flavors that you have chocolate chocolate you there is vanilla there is vanilla and it comes in they come in three different sizes so sizes sizes could be small so know each of these flavors come in each of these sizes or you could view the other way around each of these sizes come in all three flavors so now how do you construct the sample space if you gonna blindfold myself and walk into this bakery and and randomly you know somehow pick up a cupcake and you know size of the cupcake what are the possible what are the possible outcomes outcome would be both the flavor and the of ways to think about this one way is you could draw a tree you could say okay flavors i could either pick chocolate vanilla vanilla and then for each of medium or large so you could say small medium large small and then so this is a small chocolate this is a medium chocolate this is a large chocolate this is a small strawberry medium strawberry large strawberry this is a small vanilla medium vanilla large vanilla and so you again this is a medium chocolate you picked a chocolate and then it was a medium one this is a large vanilla you picked a vanilla and it is a large one and you could have done it the other way going to either pick a small medium or going to pick either a chocolate to pick a chocolate a strawberry or vanilla when i write the s over here in talking about small here you can have if you have a medium cupcake it could be chocolate it could be strawberry or it could be vanilla you have a large cupcake it could be chocolate strawberry or or vanilla so for example this was a medium chocolate cupcake over here a medium chocolate chocolate it would be that one over here so you could use these I have a tree diagram like this to think about the sample space to think about the nine possible outcomes here but you could also you could also do a I guess you could say grid or you could write the flavor so you could have chocolate chocolate actually let me just write me just let me just write the letters you can have the flavors chocolate axis and then you have your sizes you can have a small a medium or large and you can set up a grid here so this is another way to do it and notice this so set up the grid set up the grid and so what is this one going to be this is a small chocolate small small chocolate small chocolate what is this one this is going to be a small a small strawberry a small strawberry and you could just keep constructing like this where everything whoops we do the this is small having trouble changing colors all right there is a small and then this is a small this is a small vanilla this color changing vanilla and all of these these are all this would be a medium chocolate medium strawberry medium anila large chocolate large strawberry large vanilla and once again you have nine outcomes this is another way to think about all of the possible outcomes which are my cupcakes could vary another way a third way that you could do is you could literally just construct a table well you could say okay I can have a chocolate actually going to use the is the flavor column and then this is the size column size column and so you could say I could have a chocolate that chocolate that I can have there and they could be it could be small medium or large you could say there is three types of three types of strawberry to be small medium or large so let me write that in small medium large or you could say well three types of color changing again three types of vanilla once again it could be small medium or large so you have these nine possibilities now the going to do an experiment what are all the different possibilities the possible outcomes for that experiment now in the case where they are equally likely it can be very very useful because you could say you could do something like if to pick any one of these nine outcomes getting a something that is either small or chocolate and so you can see well how many of those events out of the total just a little bit of a clue of why we we even care about things like sample spaces especially sample spaces like or multiple ways that something can vary and these types of sample spaces in particular are called compound samples basis so these right over here this is a looking at two different ways that it can vary not just two heads or tails can vary by size or by flavor and you can even have compounded the sample spaces hoping to explore in this video is the that is probabilistic a trial or an experiment a sample space is just all of outcomes so a very simple trial might be coin a coin flip well then the sample space is going to be the set of all the possible outcomes so you could get a heads or you could you could get a tails that right over here is the sample space useful because in for example if these are equally likely outcomes then and you of the event of a heads you say ok outcomes or you can even construct it once you know all the possible outcomes probability distribution we at least know what the sample space is we know think about the probability of each of those outcomes but a lot of times when often there they tend to be most useful I would say when you have equally likely outcomes and like in the in the case of a fair coin flip because then from the to think about the probability of various events but this is a simple make things a little bit more bakery and at that bakery there are three types three flavors of cupcakes essentially looking at two different ways in which that the thing that where this down so we have our flavors flavors that you have chocolate chocolate you vanilla there is vanilla and it comes in they come in three different sizes so just write it out small medium or large each of these flavors come in each of these sizes or you could view the other way around each of these sizes come in all three flavors so now how do you construct the sample space if you say blindfold myself and walk into this bakery and and randomly you know somehow pick up a cupcake and you know my size of the cupcake what are the possible what are the possible outcomes outcome would be both the flavor and the of ways to think about this one way is you could draw a tree you could say okay flavors I could either pick chocolate vanilla and then for each of those or large so you could say small medium large small and so this is a small chocolate this is a medium chocolate this is a large chocolate this is a small strawberry medium strawberry large strawberry this is a small vanilla medium vanilla large vanilla and so you again this is a medium chocolate you picked a chocolate and then it was a medium one this is a large vanilla you picked a vanilla and it is a large one and you could have done it the other way going to either pick a small medium going to pick either chocolate to pick a chocolate a strawberry or vanilla when i write the s over here in talking about small so here you can have if you have a medium cupcake it could be chocolate it could be strawberry or it could be vanilla you have a large cupcake it could be chocolate strawberry or or vanilla so for example this was a medium chocolate cupcake over here a medium chocolate cupcake is this one one over here so you could use these I have a tree diagram like this to think about the sample space to think about the nine possible outcomes here but you could also you could also do a I guess you could say grid or you could write the flavor so you could have chocolate chocolate actually let me just write right so let me just let me just write time to do so you can have the flavors along that axis and then you have your sizes you could have a small a medium or large and you can set up a grid here so this is another way to do it and notice at it so set up the grid set up the grid and so what is this one going to be this is a small chocolate small small chocolate small chocolate what is this one this is going to be a small a small strawberry a small strawberry and you could just keep constructing like this about small whoops we do that there this is small having trouble changing colors there is a small and then this is a small this is a small vanilla this color thing small vanilla and all of these these are all this would be a medium chocolate medium strawberry medium vanilla large chocolate large strawberry large vanilla and once again you have nine outcomes this is another way to think about all of the possible outcomes which are my cupcakes could vary another way a third way that you could do is you could literally just construct a table well you could say okay I can have a chocolate actually going to use the is the flavor column and then this is the size column size column and so you could say I could have a chocolate that chocolate that I can have there and they could be they could be small medium or large you could say there is three types of three types of strawberry it could be small medium or large so let me write that in small medium large ',120,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Yes

Murphy my fifth video in the number systems series this is standard 7ns 1d the fourth substandard of the first standard this operations as strategies to add and subtract rational numbers there are a lot of properties but the big three are commutative property identity property of addition and the distributive commutative property what you can do for words you can add backwards Oh in mathematics of binary operation is commutative if changing the order of the operands does not change the result forwards and backwards so 3 plus 4 is 4 negative so 4 plus and negative 3 equals negative 3 plus 4 we know that 4-3 does not equal 3-4 but 4-3 also is the same as 4 plus a negative 3 and then you can with 4-3 but what if I was doing 25 minus 65 then I could say 25 plus a negative 65 is the same as negative 65 plus 25 and then i can subtract 65 minus 25 and get 40 and then make that a negative because it was a negative 65 so turning them around backwards and forwards just know that you can do it with addition and multiplication but you unless you switch things around like this the identity property of addition if you add zero to a number you get the original number you can add as many zeros as you like the official definition is the sum of zero and any other number variable is the number of variable itself so 7 plus zero is zero one half plus 0 0 negative 4 point 5 6 plus 0 is negative 4 point 5 6 and you can add a bunch of zeros so negative 7 plus 0 plus 0 plus 0 plus 0 equals 7 0 plus one-half plus 0 plus 0 is 1 half- 4.56 plus 0 plus 0 plus 0 is negative 4.56 you get you ever played with the counters you get the idea of why we might add zeros third one and probably the most important one right now is the distributive property this is actually going to be very important in algebra so they want us to start practicing right now but the distributive property is anytime you have a number outside the parentheses multiplying the parentheses you distribute it to the numbers inside the parentheses and we know from order of operations that if you have parentheses we do that first but sometimes we have a variable in our parentheses so we can solve the parentheses first so we have to practice with numbers so we can check our answers using the order of operations for example 5 times the first 4-7 is negative 3 so 5 times the quantity 4-7 is 5082 3 which is negative 15 the distributive property works this way five times the quantity 4-7 is 5 which is a negative 15 you can see we got the same answers so they do the same doing it harder example is when you have negatives inside and outside the parentheses for example 7 negative 7 times the quantity 4-8 so 4 minus 8 is negative 4 negative 7 times negative 4 is a positive 28 in the distributive property negative 7 times the quantity 4-8 we do seven negative 7 times 4 and negative 7 times negative x 8 minus negative 7 times 8 times 8 so negative 7 times 4 is negative 28 minus a negative 7 times 8 which is negative 56 minus a negative 56 is plus 56 that gives us 28 plus 56 negative 28 plus 56 which gives us 28 so those are a couple of examples try your own examples out practice them in order of operations which you know and then do them in the distributive property to check or practice them in the disturbed or property and then do the order of operations to check thank you have a great day ',57,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,Yes

properties of operations to multiply and divide rational numbers the objective today I will demonstrate my mathematical ability to utilize properties of operations to multiply and divide rational numbers without the use of a calculator cleared class discussion this is very similar to that lesson that we had a couple weeks ago about the going to look at pretty much the same thing with multiplication division ok the toolbox words you need it make sure you adders the associative property of multiplication the community property of multiplication and then the distributive property going to look at is I can rearrange the grouping of numbers as exactly like that using it with multiplication and the same thing with the community property of multiplication I can change the order answer at all and that is a community property of multiplication now the first you really have to talk about the distributive property robots real quick ok so with the distributive property I have a number usually with going distribute it to everything on the inside okay so I multiply it times this first term and times this second term those two 5 times 3 is 15 plus 1 is 16 negative 6 times 16 over 3 gonna cross reduce that that is a 1 2 3 divided by 3 is 1 negative 6 divided by a negative right through E is a negative 2 right so now I have a negative 2 times 16 which is going to be 1 dw2 so I bring that back over you have a negative 32 plus negative 6 times negative 4 and negative times they pop or negative 4 negative 6 times positive going to be a negative so my answer is 6 times 4 is 24 okay and now I can simply add negative 32 plus negative 24 when I add a negative plus a negative is a negative property basically the number outside or distributing it also to the 4 now I have a problem like this it looks it but guess what I can use I can use the commutative property and I can times negative 8 times 9 okay times one third times a negative 1 hand now I could also change the grouping here I can go multiply this and the reason I would do that is because I know gonna have a lot of fractions left over multiple ways to do this all right minute so I have 4 times and negative 8 to be the same thing I move this 1/2 to where I can get rid of it pretty easily I can do that either with the floor or a negative 8 times a negative 1/2 I change the grouping again times 3 okay negative 8 times 1/2 is 4 positive and 8 times 1/2 is 4 so then I have 4 times 4 times 3 4 times 4 is 16 16 times 3 is going to be 48 now this that could have done it so in this problem hey everybody look at the distributive property again however rearrange this because I have 16 times the negative 3/8 plus a 16 one for well I should go 16 times a negative 3/8 plus 1/4 because look at this if I put 4 this is around this 1/4 to add I mean have a common denominator so a common denominator here is going to be 8 so what I did afford to get me to negative 3/8 plus a positive 2 8 so if I look at memory is negative 3 plus positive 2 the signs are different so I must subtract 3 minus 2 is 1 okay and then the sign goes to that of the larger number there are larger absolute value negative 3 has a large opposite value is farther from 0 on the number line so therefore this is negative so 9 have 16 times a negative 1 or 16 over 1 times a reduce now was the greatest common factor of 8 and 16 well that would be 8 8 divided by 8 is 1 16 divided by 8 is 2 now I simply multiply 2 times a negative 1 is a negative 2 because remember 8 positive times a negative is a negative I have one negative sign odd number so they answered this problem would be simply negative to now I could have gone through in multiply 16 times and negative 3 8 and then out of that to 16 times 1 4 if I would have done that I would have gotten this exact same answer different one on what we can use the properties to help us take a look at the problems multiple ways we can do it the to try to get it all in the same upwards actually multiply by the reciprocal they saw I have 1 times 3 over 2 which is just 3 over 2 times a negative 8 times 3 Weathers typical loose typical of 1/2 is negative 2 I could write this negative 2 to at this moment okay now I have negative 1 times 3 halves or just simply 3 halves okay times a negative 8 times 3 negative 2 times 3 halves times a negative 8 times 3 why did I do that one I can see here I could cross reduce and I can get these twos so they are reduced so to do by the way this one factor of 2 and 2 is 2 2 divided by 2 is 1 and 3 negative 1 negative 1 times 3 is simply a negative 3 times a negative 8 times three I could rearranges one more time I could go negative 3 times 3 times a negative 8 right negative 3 times negative 3 is going to be our pot negative 9 negative 9 times a negative 8 is going to end up being a positive 72 different times and I was able to do that for the use of the properties I remember we have three of them now we have the associative probably change the order or change the grouping I have the commutative property where I change the order I did that here and I did that here all right I have the distributive property where the number outside the everything on the inside the parentheses all right make sure you have all those down and have your WSQ filled out and

Suzie reads 45 books in 15 dates all that means malicious set up the proportion first of all find the unit rate if Suzie reads 45 books in 15 okay the unit rate anytime I ask for the you know write it wants to know how many in one day okay so whatever the bottom number is it wants to know how many in one day so all you would do is you would just divide 45 by 15 you just take this top number and divide it by the bottom edge just like you would a percent or to find a decimal divided by 15 but hmm put that in your calculators here clear 45 divided by us could do that in our head but we got one day she could read three books now we come over here and I know I see fractions and I know that you guys you know just like fractions the awesome thing about this is I can tell you or subtracting any fractions so yay Tom swims 1/2 mile every 1/2 quarter-hour how far will he swim in one hour okay going to be putting on the bottom it wants to know how much in one hour so it drawing a long line because I need to cover my units also in 1/4 hours well than 1 hour just dividing the top number by the 1/2 notice how I did it like this I did that on purpose guys divided by 1/4 okay now we remember how to divide fractions we keep the first one we change from division to multiplication and we flip the second one the reciprocal okay upside down okay so 1 times 4 equals 4 and 2 times 1 equals 2 I could leave it want to know how many miles in two hours right now I have 4 miles in two hours I doing it twice 4 divided by 2 is 2 so they can do 2 miles in 1 miles per hour point five pound bag of apples cost $22.50 what is the unit price now be to know how many pounds per dollar you want to know how many dollars per pound right so think about that you have very useful for your real life when what the best deal is I have a 4.5 use my calculator to do this because okay make sure you pay attention that decimal point the one good thing about having the calculator beyond the computer is you can see your decimals really well you what you just did for point five this is really important to pay attention to you because if you give the answer wrong go back and look and see what it says because maybe you accidentally pushed a plus sign or multiplication sign instead of a division sign so that equals five so it came out even which is great so five dollars per one pound okay five dollars per pound so for one pound it will cost five dollars which is actually kind of a lot for apples by the way how much would you pay for a pint of milk if you bought five gallons of milk for $28 okay guys this is where fourth grade comes back to bite you because okay if you cannot remember how many pints in the gallon or whatnot you can always remember you have gallo Nia the land of Bella Mia and in the land of galilea there were four Queen okay and each Queen had a prince and it princess that each prince and princess had two pints in a quart so now I know that in one gallon I have one two three four five six seven eight eight pints but I gallons remember how much would you pay for a pint so one pint I want to know so how many pints do I have in five gallons so $28 is for five gallons of milk okay but I here because I want to know for how much for a plank okay now I could do for one gallon and I could find out that $20 divided by five gallons is five point six five dollars and sixty cents for one gallon okay which is a very expensive by the way I would never pay this much want one down I want one pint so how many pints are in a gallon all I have to do is take this gallon out and go one two three four five six seven eight put eight pints do you see why writing out your units is you toll because I know that if this was on the milestones five point six would be an answer five dollars and sixty cents would be an and you think you were a genius but then the testing people would be sitting there laughing going hahaha we got another one so pints for one pint so five point six divided by eight pints divided by 8 and 0.7 so that would be 70 cents point seven dollars for one pint still kind of expensive because you buy a plaint of milk at school and then cost you like 25 cents 50 cents so this is very expensive but anyway this is the correct answer just so you know ',797,3,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,Yes

If the price of a bike is $180, how much is the discount and what is the new sales price? Now, notice that they want two things here. They want the discount, and they want what the new sales price would be. the original amount minus the original amount times the percent of change is equal to the new amount. Change the 20% to .20. Multiply 180 times .20. We get 36. Now, notice that this answers one of the questions already because $36 is the actual amount of discount. So, that is our actual sales price, $144. All they wanted was the new sales price. Okay, so if we look at part of that equation, the one minus percent of change, well, the decrease of 20% would be 100% minus 20%, which is 80%, which is .80 as a decimal. So now, I can directly plug in my numbers. The original amount is 180. The percent change would be .80, which is $144. Now, if we had done it this way and they also wanted to know the actual discount, well, we can just take this a step further. We know that if you take the difference between the original price that they had it marked at So, the original price was 180. We got it for\\n144. Take the difference between the two. Now, that type of context is not going to be that much different than simple interest and tax and so forth. find the actual amount of the gratuity\\nor the actual amount of the commission. So, like in this case, typical scenario, the\\ntip for a meal, the meal is $24.50, the gratuity rate is 15%. So, how much is the tip? So, all we really need is this part where the actual amount of change is going to be the original amount times the percent of change. and when we multiply those two, that will give us the actual tip amount. So, we multiply $24.50 times .15, and we get 3.675... So, we have to round that up. those types of contexts are going to be very similar to some of those others like taxes and so forth. directly to percent increase and decrease. Now, out of all of these contexts, percent increase and decrease, for\\nwhatever reason give people a lot of difficulty. Part of it really boils down to well, what is\\nit that I am comparing to? and we derived a formula or a relationship from it, and we had a second version of it\\nwhere we used the distributive property Now, we can actually derive where the percent increase and decrease relationship comes from, and will get a handle for what really goes on and remember the process a lot better. Now, when it comes to the percent increase and decrease, So, if we take this relationship, and we treat it like So, the first thing we have to do on both sides of the equal sign, we need to subtract the original amount, We need to get rid of the original amount on the left-hand side of the equation. So, this time we need to divide by the original amount, and when we do that, this is what we have. So, we actually derived the relationship, the equation. The percent of change would be the new amount, whatever that is, minus the original amount, the\\ndifference between the two, and you always compare to the original amount before the change happened. Again, the percent increase or decrease, which would be your percent change, is always going to be the difference of the two amounts that includes whatever the change was, minus the original amount before the change happened. the difference between the new amount and the original amount will be positive. If the difference between the new amount and the original amount but it will go up to $500 next month. Ouch! and compare it back to the original amount. We just have to be a little bit careful here and make sure that we understand which is which. The original amount was $400, so we plug 400 in place of the original amount, and then $500 is the new amount. Convert that to a decimal and then to a percent. So, we get 25%. He found a better rate of $400 a month. Okay, start with our basic fundamental equation; figure out the new amount and original amount. So, we have -100/500, which as a decimal would be -.20, which is -20%. So, by changing insurance, going from $500 a month to a new payment of $400 a month, again, that is a 20% decrease. Now, notice that even though the answer was negative, Again, we have a decrease of 20%. Now, back in sixth grade there was standard 6.NS.C.7c that talks about understanding the absolute value of a rational number as a distance from\\nzero on the number line. So, what we can do here to kind of understand the relationships a little better is to just look at this in terms of absolute value. So, when we get that -20%, we really just need the a decrease rather than an increase. Notice that in both these scenarios, we were talking about 400 and 500, but in one case, in the rent increase, compared to the insurance decrease, well, we came out with different percentages. For the increase in the rent, it was 25%, but the decrease in the insurance was 20% even though we were dealing with the same two quantities, 400 and 500. But again, it boils down to, well what was the original amount? For the rent increase, the comparison was\\nback to the original rent of $400. $500 a month in insurance, and the change was based on 500. that we are always comparing back to the original amount. In this case, for the rent increase we were comparing to 400 as opposed to the insurance decrease where we started off with 500; again, very, very important that kids realize the distinction here. You always compare the difference of the two amounts to the original amount before the change occurred. and these types of contexts will be very similar to the percent increase or decrease. So, percent error, percent changethe same idea, but there is some distinction. There might be a little bit more difficulty determining which is the new amount and\\nwhich is the original amount. Again, the decision here is going to be a\\nlittle bit more difficult, but again, in a percent error situation, what am I going to compare to? Marla guessed that there are 450 of them. What was the percent error? Now we have to figure out, well what are we going to use for the new amount and the original amount? of jelly beans because we are going to see how far off that the guess was. So, the actual amount is going to be the original amount, and the new amount should be what was guessed. and subtract the actual number of jelly beans and compare that to the actual number of jelly beans. So we plug in our numbers. She guessed 450 and the actual amount of jelly beans is 480. We get -30/480, which as a decimal would be -.0625. Now, the percent error is 6.25%. But hey, wait a minute. There was a negative involved here. Well, okay. Go back again to that absolute value standard back in sixth grade, 6.NS.C.7c. So, we had a percent error of -.0625, but if we just look at the absolute value, the error is 6.25%. What happens here is that again, the\\nnegative just indicates where we were as far as the actual guess. She guessed 450, so she was actually low on her estimation. One more example of percent error: the marketing department estimated $400,000 in sales for the year. The actual sales were $450,000. What was the percent error in the sales estimate? Now, we need to decide what amount is which. So, the actual sales amount was $450,000. and subtract the actual amount and compare it to the actual amount to get our percent error. Compare that to the actual sales of 450,000. We get -50,000/450,000, which is .1111 repeating, which is 11.11%. And again, the reason it was a negative difference was because again, we underestimated. We guessed $400,000 and the actual sales were $450,000. If we look at the first four, if we do some of these activities, Students will make sense of problems and persevere in solving them. They should construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others, and they will be modeling the mathematics. If we look at the last four standards of mathematical practice, students will be attending to precision, and they will look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

This standard states: Draw (freehand with ruler and protractor and with technology) geometric shapes with given conditions. Focus on constructing triangles from\\nthree measures of angles or sides, noticing when the conditions determine a unique triangle, more than one triangle, or no triangle. Back in fourth grade, there was standard 4.MD.C.5a that gave students exposure to angles and angle measure. This fourth-grade standard states: An angle is measured with reference to a circle with its center at the common endpoint of the rays by considering the fraction of the circular arc between the points where the two rays intersect the circle. Also in fourth grade, a related standard was 4.MD.C.6 that talked about actually measuring\\nangles in whole-number degrees using a protractor. Also in fourth grade, there is standard 4.G.A.1 that talks about drawing points, lines, line segments, rays, and angles. And notice that they do introduce the classifications of angles based on measure, those being right, acute, and obtuse angles. This should, in turn, help students identify triangles based on angle measures. So, that would give them some background and a little bit of experience with the terms that would lead to right triangle, acute triangle, and obtuse triangle. Note that this is the only Common Core standard where the term obtuse is mentioned. Also, the term acute only appears again at the high school level with regard to trigonometry. Another standard in fourth gradethis one is 4.G.A.2. This one talks about classifying two-dimensional figures based on the presence or absence of parallel or perpendicular lines, or the presence or absence of angles of a specific size. Notice the last statement: Recognize right triangles as a category, and identify right triangles. Notice that when addressing standard 7.G.A.2, that seems like an appropriate time to classify triangles based on angle measure. which leads to the idea of the sum of the angles of a triangle being 180. This seventh-grade standard will help set the foundation for standard 8.G.A.2, which talks about two-dimensional figures being congruent to one another. Notice that this eighth-grade standard is the first mention of the concept of congruency in the Common Core standards. In eighth grade, we have this other standard 8.G.A.5 that talks about using informal arguments to establish facts about the angle sum of triangles. If we switch our focus a little bit to the idea of constructing triangles from measures of sides versus angles, there is this high school standard, HSG.CO.C.10, that talks about proving theorems about triangles and that includes measures of interior angles of a triangle sum being 180, and the base angles of isosceles triangles being congruent. Notice that this high school standard is the only standard where the term isosceles appears. Also, the term scalene is not mentioned anywhere in the standards, and the term equilateral does not occur until the high school Geometry standards. when it comes to the classification of triangles based on the sides. seems like an appropriate time to classify triangles based on the lengths of the sides. In looking at the standard and these last statements dealing with the conditions that determine different contexts as far as the number of triangles, if we look at the idea of having more than one triangle formed, So, this standard here, 7.G.A.2, can help lay the foundation for the idea of similar figures that will come up in eighth grade. Again, this standard in eighth grade is the first formal mention of the concept of similarity in the mathematics content standards. But again, we can use this seventh-grade\\nstandard to start laying the foundation for that whether or not we use the actual mathematical terminology. Teachers should be able to find some type of software that can actually be used to measure angles, We have a protractor that we can use to measure angles, and so, this is a very useful tool that again, we can use. So, we take our protractor and we do that; and so we use our ruler to mark off that segment so that we have this ray. This is the beginning foundation for our triangle. So far, we have our one angle of 34 degrees. Okay, we have a little bit of a problem here. The way that the protractor is set up, I can measure the 71 degrees here, but I need the angle measure over here. So, what am I going to do? We can use the measure of 109 degrees over here, We can use this little trick of using the supplement of an angle to get the angle that we want. instead to get the 71-degree angle that we want as part of our triangle. So, now we would use our ruler and draw our segment. the angle measure is for this third angle up at the top. So, we take our protractor, put it in position, look at our measurement, and yes, it is 75 degrees. So, now we have our third angle being 75 degrees. then students are going to come up\\nwith different sized triangles. So, this sets up this idea of these triangles being similar. So, in fact, if you look at this in terms of the actual sides, we will have more than one triangle formed. So, this might be an example here of what some of the different triangles that students come up with would look like. Now, we can use this and link it to standard 8.G.A.4, but what we can also do is link this to standard 8.G.A.5 and use it to discover or informally prove that the sum of the interior angles of the triangle is 180 degrees. So, this is what we can do to do that. Pick out three different sized triangles, but all of them have the same three degree measures. Now, notice the three different angles here that come from three different triangles. We have our 71, our 75, and our 34, and if you add them up, that is 180 degrees and that is our straight angle here. Now, the standard talks about constructing triangles from three measures of angles, but we can throw the students a little\\nbit of a curve. What if we asked them to construct a triangle with angle measures 22 and 136? So, we do that. Take our segment, and so we have our angle, but what we can do is get the supplement 158, extend this other segment a little bit. There you go. Now the question is, well, that third angle in this triangle, what is the measure for that one? If we take our protractor and measure it, look what happens. they will end up making more than one triangle out of it. So, again, this might be an example of what they come up with, even though their lengths of the sides might be different sizes. Construct a triangle with angle measures 93, 64, and 43. Okay,  just like before, we have a little bit of a problem. I want my 93-degree angle on the left, not on the right. So, we have our 93-degree angle. and use this endpoint on the left So here we go. Extend your segment. So, we have our 43-degree and our 93-degree angles. So, now the question is the 64 degrees. Is that going to be that top angle? The protractor is saying 44 degrees Well, it turns out this is impossible. that can be formed with these three angles, and of course, what students can do is verify whether or not those three angles that were given add up to be 180 degrees. So, given similar tasks where the sum of the three angles is not 180 degrees, students will discover that no triangle is possible. So far, students have constructed triangles based on information regarding angle measure. The results included acute, right, and obtuse triangles. Students should note that when\\nonly given information about angle measures, the constructed triangles were similar even though no information was provided regarding side lengths, and students should also realize that the sum of the three interior angles of a triangle must be 180 degrees.

want to know is what are all of the possible outcomes here what is the sample space what is the space from which we are going to pick your particular vacation package well for the sample space we can

three day island trip day ski trip to day ski trip three day ski trip and then finally everything in this third row there are camping trips one day camping trip two day camping trip three-day camping trip so just like that we have constructed in the sample space right over here you see that that each of these outcomes are a little piece of paper and they put it in a barrel and they roll it up and for our purposes we can assume that they are all assume equally likely outcomes so if we do assume equally likely outcomes we can figure out a probability maybe you you ask ourselves a question what is the probability what is the probability that at least two days on a vacation without snow two days on vacation without that gives you at least a vacation with think a little bit about it we know the sample space and we know each of the outcomes are equally likely there are nine equally equal outcomes here so outcomes now how many of the SAC outcomes satisfy this this event this this this constraint at least two day two days of the vacation I mean two day let me write this two days days without snow whether it falls or touching it or avoiding skiing you want at least two days on something other than skiing and this is two days without snow so we can circle that one this is three days without snow so we can circle that one all of these have snow this is one day without snow is two days without snow and this is three days without snow and so four of the equally likely outcomes satisfy this constraint so you have a 4/9 probability of getting a B getting a vacation that keeps you away from snow for at least two days hopefully found that fun and useful for the next time that you are on pick your fantabulous vacation and so there are three possible places that you could go

writing and solving word problems so number one identify the variables and the constants number two identify the relationship between those variables and constants and number three use the relationship to build the equation and number four would be to solve the solve step number four step is couple weeks about solving one and at an example so your class is going to the state fair the trip cost $52 included in that price is $11 for one concert ticket and the cost of two passes each pass costs the same price write an equation representing this trip all right so first things first step one the cost of each pass because it says the cost of two passes each cost the the variable the variable is the cost of going to write is let X equal the cost of each pass this is just simply saying the X is equal to cost of the past we right what do we know well we do know the cost of the concert ticket which it already states in the sentence included in that price is $11 for one concert ticket we know that the cost or ticket cost $11 every time all right so our constant is $11 or 11 about the relationship between that variable and the constant so to get our final trip costs we need to combine the cost of the passes and the cost of the concert ticket so we need to combine relationship to make our equation will combine another word that means combine figure out an equation with that so it says the trip costs fifty two dollars so be equal okay included in that price is eleven dollars so we know our constants know the cost of each pass but we do our equation is going to be 52 is equal to 2x plus 11 all right our last step is solve that equation together so now over again first things first subtract the 11 from both sides subtract the constant 52 minus 11 is 41 bring down the equals sign the 11s cancel out that leaves us just with 2x to undo the 2x we need to divide both sides by 2 41 divided by 2 is $20.50 is equal to X so our answer to this word problem is each take it or each pass cost $20.50 so write that sentence each pass costs 20 dollars and 50 cents okay the sentence really just helps us know we know exactly what that number means in another example the company could charges 15 dollars a day if your insurance covers 150 dollar right in equation to determine how many days you can rent a vehicle with that money so first of all we want to know what figure out what we know we know how not know we do not know how many days that we can rent yet so that means our variable X is going to be days of rental so we write that as let X equal days of rental what do we know will we know that the cost to rent and vehicle is $45 no matter how many days that you rent that of like a down payment $45 every single time no matter how many days all right so our constant is gonna be $45 okay so now we need to know the relationship so the relationship is we renting the vehicle how much it cost per days and the cost the down payment to get a hundred and fifty dollars so our relationship is to go bind them to equal the cost of the rental so to find the insurance is going to cost us $150 so we total so $150 is equal to we want to know how many days and it costs 15 per day so one hundred and fifty dollars is equal to 15 X plus 45 all right so what we know how much money we have is equal second and solve so after we get the equation we know how to solve this so first we subtract 45 from both sides because we want to get rid of the constant a hundred and fifty minus 45 is 105 bring down the equal sign the 45 together that equals multiplication to undo multiplication we need to divide divide both sides by 15 the 15s cancel out that with X is equal to 105 divided by 15 which is 7 all right so that means you can rent the car for seven days so the insurance pays for the car so the insurance the insurance pays for seven days of rental okay so seven is the days of rental all right so at this point in time here is the youtai problem and university charges a thousand dollars per semester for a student to attend additionally they charge three hundred dollars for every credit our student enrolls in for a semester write an equation to find out how many credit hours the student is enrolled if their bill is six thousand four hundred dollars so take a second pause the video write down the equation and try to solve alright and at this point if you have any questions whatsoever please write them down okay please write down any questions and then we will go over these in class doing a lot more examples before you see this on an assessment so thank you so much for actively listening thank you for taking good notes and I will see you later ',285,2,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,Yes

welcome back today we are going to be talking about adjacent vertical supplementary and complementary angles so we are going to be diving into our geometry unit today so our objective for today is I will be able to identify and solve adjacent vertical supplementary and complementary angle problems so first we need to define a few things so first thing adjacent angles so GC angles are side by side and they share a common ray so take a look at this example these angles the 45 degree angle and the 15 degree angle are adjacent angles because they share common later they share this common ray goes coming out right here right next to each other and they share this ray ok so here are all examples of important that you write these down so then you can see many different types of adjacent angles so we have 35 and a 55 the shared common ray and 80 degree in a 45 degree that shared there for common ray and 85 and at 20 the share common ray and then 130 and a 50 the share a common ray there are two angles that share a common ray these are not differences these are side by side but they do not share a common ray these two angles that are shown here the 55 and you start at the point or at the of the angle there is no common between them they just come from the same point and then these are not adjacent because they do not share a common ray our next vocabulary word is vertical angles so vertical angles is a vocabulary word and intersect alright so you can see we have a 105 degree angle 75 105 and 75 so the vertical angles are the ones that are opposite of each other so vertical angles are opposite so 75 degrees in 75 degrees also means that they are congruent or the same so vertical angles and they are both equal or congruent the other example we have here is we have a hundred and fifty degree angle and another 150 degree angle their opposite or vertical angles degree angles are vertical angles or equal are congruent the next vocabulary word that we have is supplementary angles and supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees a lot of line you remember straight-line is 180 so it has a straight line with a ray coming out of it we have 180 and 60 so we know that that 120 plus 60 is equal to 180 so we know that these are supplementary angles okay and these happen to be adjacent this right here is also supplementary they do not share a common ray so we can check ourselves by 40 plus 140 is equal to 180 yes indeed they are because 40 plus 140 is 180 okay the next pair of Arran vocabulary word is supplementary complementary angles add up to 90 degrees so how do we remember that and how I remember that is complementary C is the smaller one or 90 degrees C comes before s in the alphabet so 90 degrees comes before 180 complementary angles look we have a 30 degree angle on a 60 so 30 plus 60 is equal to 90 and yes indeed does so we know that these are complementary angles and this first a common ray complementary angles but not adjacent 40 plus 50 is indeed 90 they just do not share a common ray so these are complementary angles okay so determine the missing angle side all right so number one we have this this image okay so we have a 45 degree trying to finding out find up the missing side so since this is a supplementary angle the supplementary angle we know that this line here this going to make an equation and set it take the side that we know well we know that one side is 45 degrees then to get know so x equals 180 now this should look awfully familiar one step equation we subtract 45 from both sides these cancel out that leaves us with x is equal to 100 sorry x is equal to 135 open and lost my cursor here there it goes 135 degrees okay so this right here 135 degrees you can check yourself by plugging it back in 135 plus 45 is indeed 180 okay so we know that this is correct our next example is of a complementary angle okay and as you can see this is a 90 degree angle so it seems concept a 90 degree angle we know that these two when we add them together they have to equal 90 degrees equals 90 subtract 65 from both sides so X is equal to 25 this next image we are talking about is an example of a of a vertical angle vertical angle because you can see that these two look they are they are opposite or congruent so because they are equal and it is a vertical angle we know that this is also say well what is this angle right here be the same well you can see that this so straight line that I just drew so 180 degrees is equal to 35 plus 6 subtract 35 from both sides okay borrow a little bit 10 minus 5 is 5 7 minus 3 is 4 145 so X is equal to 145 so we just found that the missing sides for all the one that we just did this is another example of a supplementary angle so you that means is going to be set equal to 180 we know 50s are one side lengths and we by both sides so X is equal to 130 okay look at this okay we have now we have another vertical angle example so we know that across it or opposite of it of 140 is 140 okay we could also figure out right here these two okay subtract 140 from both sides so X is equal to 40 so we know that this would equal to 40 our last example before the you try problem is a square and we drew a triangle or a line to make two triangles and we want to know what this site is to we know that the corner of a square is right angle and so this is a complementary angle so 90 is equal to 40 plus X subtract 40 from both sides and Riaan can tell the X is equal to 50 impose noodles in there even if you forget the common names for them you can kind of use your eyeballs and say ask yourself is this a 90 degree angle this is a 180 degree angle now you will need to know the vocabulary words and degrees and supplementary is later in the alphabet bigger right so here are the two you try problems for today you have one complimentary and one supplementary angle problem so go back looking your notes try to figure this out and as always if you have any questions please write them down for me to answer when you come back to class so thank you so much for actively listening and I will see you guys later bye-bye

this is 7ee one seventh-grade expressions and equations one video one gonna be moving some items around manipulating them okay a few terms to your journals and define them please alright this is a algebraic expression an equal sign now if it had an equal sign we would be calling this an parts of this number sentence I guess we an equal sign better known as an coefficients that means I am looking for an integer that is attached to a variable literally stuck to the front of right here I see that I have the the number or integer that is stuck to right here I see one X so my one of my coefficients is called one now do I have any other coefficients down the line looking for variables I see an X and the number that is stuck to the X is this negative sign so you take the sign in front so this is a negative two coefficient the next part are the constant terms now the constant terms are the integers in to right I can see a four and I can see listing these items is because in this find out that we are going to have to simplify these expressions and put these like terms together to kind of shorten the length of this expression so looking for the like terms I know that I have variables that are called X so the like terms would be positive 1x and negative 2x the other like terms are the constant move on this is just kind of identifying certain terms in an expression I think on the next slide we have one property so before we start listing the coefficients constants and like terms I see a set of parentheses in this problem right here now if we were following the order of operations we would try to get this w and negative 4 together now had W been some integer I could do the math inside of the parentheses first however touching the parentheses 5 touching in the parentheses or grouping symbol means we multiply so I have 5 x the quantity of W minus 4 so that means I need to use my distributive frog so my distributive property says take the five and multiply it by each term on the inside five multiplied by W is 5w + 5 multiplied by negative 4 is negative 20 and I just bring down my other terms of the expression because they are not anything with them yet and again the property we just used is school years now that I have used my distributive property I have this long line of terms in this expression and just going to be identifying or naming the different parts first the attached to the variables I see a positive 5 and I see a positive 1 my constant terms are negative 20 and 8 and by 5w and I 1w negative twenty-eight all right now again that is going to be important when we start combining like terms adding subtracting using our operations to coming up here we have a word problem it says a rectangular soccer field is 30 years 30 years 30 yards longer than it is wide right and simplify an expression for the perimeter of the field in terms of the width W so a couple of key words in here that we are going to be dealing with the length and the width of a rectangle and ultimately they want us to find the perimeter the perimeter R or the perimeter is the distance around this figure when we add them up so the sum of all of the sides will get us the perimeter of this rectangle our key number in here is this 30 yards I know that this field is 30 yards longer than the figure so that is the terms of W so W what I do know about my length which is this long side I know that this length is 30 yards longer than the width it as a variable and I know that it is 30 yards longer than the width so that would be W plus 30 now we would like to write and simplify an expression so the expression would be the sum of all of your sides so if I were to write out all of the sides I would have an additional W and another W sides so we would have a W plus a W doing the perimeter a length which is W plus 30 and another length the other side of the of your figure which would be W plus 30 now that is a very long expression I have another way that I can plus 2w that would be 2 times my length plus 2 times my width that would get me the perimeter of this rectangle so I can go how about 2 times my length plus 2 times my width now if I were to simplify this expression it says write and simplify they would like us to get all of our my first expression I have a W another W one plus one plus another one plus a fourth one so I would have 4w and then my constant terms those were my variable terms with the coefficient my constant terms are positive 30 plus another 30 so we would the width so we are unable to figure out the actual perimeter of this figure so if we did know a measurement of the width we could substitute in our values itself now just on a side note down here on the bottom if you wanted to use your perimeter equation we would have to distribute use our distributive property so we would come up with 2w plus 6t and another 2w combine your like terms 2w plus 2w is 4w and then you have your 60 so we get the same answer both ways now according to the standard we are going to be taking these addition subtraction problems these operation taking this expression and we are going to be putting our like terms together and this takes us all the way back to the beginning of the year with adding and subtracting fractions the only difference here is that we now have this coefficient term that is touching the coefficient which is a fraction touching vertically this is an addition problem add that this is the addition sign to have to worry about getting a common denominator because they already gave us common denominator so we know that we can take our numerators and add them so I have 2 plus 3 which is 5/7 X we got with our axis and now we are going to combine our constant terms so we read it as positive 8 add it to negative 4 we also recall our integer rules so when we have a positive 8 and we add it to a negative 4 we come up with a positive 4 and there is your final expression now I call them apples and oranges if it has an X with it it is different than the to it so final answer 5 7 X plus 4 No please define the given terms on page 2 of the flip chart and write a few sentences on what you learned from this video if you have questions feel free to ask them and I will see you in class ',2021,11,11,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,Yes

my name is Maria Miller gonna study some problems that involve drawing triangles my first problem is to draw an equilateral triangle I will show you a method to draw it using ruler and compass and I will start out by drawing here and now I will take the compass okay in an equilateral triangle all three sides are congruent they have the same length so I will now draw a circle that has this as its radius the third vertex of the triangle is it somewhere here but it is at the same distance from this point as this one is so it will be on the arc of a circle somewhere and then we will do the same with this point so first I will put the center point of the circle here and set the radius here then draw an arc of a circle here then now I simply connect these vertices okay hold on a question though can I draw many different equilateral triangles the answer is of course yes because in the beginning when I chose the length of this side I could have chosen it infinite number of different equilateral triangles they all are similar they all information that they were going to use question and we draw only one triangle with this information how can we draw several different a triangle with angles 35 degrees 100 degrees and 55 degrees anything about the side length so again I could just choose any any length for for example this one side here the bottom side say 35 degrees would go over there angle would be 100 degrees it could be here right oh it could be here or I could use the 55 degree angle maybe put 55 degrees yeah over there yes this is now 55 degrees and now the triangle is already there so this over here must be the hundred degree angle but in the beginning I could have chosen a longer side here or shorter one so they are again an infinite number of these kind of triangles when you are given the three angles for triangle it does not totally define the triangle triangle with 70 degree and 95 degree angles and a 16 centimeters side between them so this time we know two angles and a side between them so let me start out by drawing the side right here and then drawing those two angles 16 centimeters and then 70 degree angle from here and then 95 degree angle from from this vertex there now what happens is I have to continue these sides but eventually they will meet in one point right so there is only one this kind of triangle I cannot draw many different ones using this information a triangle with 20 centimeter and 30 centimeter sides and a 60 degree angle between them this time I know two sides and an angle so I could start out by drawing one of the sides then measuring the 60 degree angle that way and then measuring the side here right and then see what happens to me it looks like it will define the triangle because then I will have a vertex here vertex here and then I just draw in the third side so example the 30 centimeters side here and then 60 degree angle there okay this was 30 centimeters this was 60 degrees and then I will measure that 20 centimeters side here okay and so now I have any choices so there is only one unique triangle using this information now we are going to draw a triangle with three given sides 20 centimeters 25 centimeters and use the compass again in the same manner as I used here but since it gives us the side lengths I will first draw one of to get the 20 centimeter side okay you the 14 centimeter side here because I do not know which direction it is gonna go but I can use a circle if I draw here a circle with 20 centimeter radius then I know that the third vertex is somewhere on that circular arc and then I draw another circle using this as a center and with 14 centimeters as a radius okay third vertex is on that circular arc to wherever those two circular arcs the sect is the third vertex of this set it to 20 centimeters first of all okay now the compass is set 20 centimeters put the centre here under on arc another compass is set to 14 centimeters and I use this as my centre and there there will be the third vertex and now just draw the sides in again I hope you can see that this information defined a unique triangle I could not have changed always gonna be this kind now okay I could have changed that the 14 centimeters here and then the 20 centimeters here but the resulting triangle would be like a mirror image of this one it is actually congruent to this triangle lastly a triangle with sides 25 centimeters 14 and 7 compass set to 14 centimeters and then his compass set to 7 centimeters so what meet so therefore there is no triangle here no triangle the 7 centimeters is too little all this 14 is too small an amount I would need to increase one or the other to become a bigger number so I would get a bigger radius here or bigger radius here so they would actually meet given three numbers of side lengths for triangle then you will either get the one unique triangle or no triangle at all okay we are now all done with this lesson

This says the proportion\\nrelationship between the distance driven and the amount of time driving shown in the following graph,\\nso we have the distance driven along the horizontal axis. We can tell just visually\\nthat this, indeed, is a proportional relationship,\\nhow do we know that? Well, the point (0, 0) is on this graph, the graph goes through the origin. If we have zero time, then we\\nhave zero distance, and we can If you have a linear\\nrelationship that goes through You could also see that by\\ntaking out some points here. does the graph kind of hit\\na very well-defined point. Actually, point A right\\nover here, we see that when our time is five hours, our distance travelled or driven is 400 km. Then if we look at time,\\nthis point right over here, when our time is 2.5, we see that our distance driven is 200 km. And notice, the ratio\\nbetween these variables at any one of these points is the same. 400 divided by five is 80, and 200 divided by 2.5\\nis also going to be 80. Or if you wanna go the other way around, to go from time to distance, In fact, we can say that\\ndistance divided by time, our proportionality\\nconstant is going to be 80. Or if we wanted to\\ninclude the units there, it might be a little\\nmore obvious than dealing with the rate, distance is in\\nkilometers, time is in hours, 80 km per hour, this is the rate at which we are driving. We are going at this\\nspeed, 80 km per hour. This is also the proportionality constant. Anyway, with all of that out of the way, Which statements about the graph are true? Select all that apply. The vertical coordinate\\nof point A represents the distance driven in four hours. The vertical coordinate. So point A is at the coordinate (5, 400). The vertical coordinate\\ntells us how high to go up, how far to move in the vertical direction. so this is the vertical coordinate. in four hours, so yes, the\\nvertical coordinate of point A represents the distance\\ndriven in four hours. The distance driven in one hour is 80 km. When you just try to eyeball\\nit off of the graph here, at more than 75, so yeah, 80\\nseems like a reasonable one. But we see it even more\\nclearly when we look at the calculation that we did. If you take a distance,\\nany one of these distance, 400 km over five hours, tells you that your rate is 80 km per hour, and you know this is going\\nto happen for any point It goes through the\\norigin and it is a line. So the distance travelled in\\none hour is going to be 80 km none of the above because I\\nfound two choices that I liked. A grocery story sells cashews. The relationship between\\nweight and cost of cashews is shown in the following\\ngraph, and once again, we see it is a proportional relationship. It goes through the\\norigin, and it is a line. Which statements about the graph are true? Select all that apply. The point (0, 0) shows the cost. Yeah, that makes sense. shows the cost is $2 for 60 kg of cashews, the cost is\\n$2 for 60 kg of cashews. No, this is showing us\\nthat the cost is $60 the cost is $60 for 2 kg of cashews. You have a mass of 2 kg,\\nI guess you could say the horizontal coordinate\\ntells you the mass. The vertical coordinate tells\\nyou the cost, and that is $60. That would be a deal, if you could get, this is what a medium-sized grown man would weigh 60 kg, and\\n$2 for that much cashews, that would be an incredible deal. So you definitely wanna rule that one out. figured that I liked the\\nfirst choice up there. An employee earns an hourly\\nwage shown in the graph below. Find the hourly wage. We see here in the horizontal\\naxis, we have hours worked, and in the vertical axis, earnings. And that makes sense, the ratio\\nbetween earnings and hours at a constant rate, we see it visually, We could say hours, hours, then dollars. And just the fact, visually, that we know $40 per hour. If we take dollars divided by hours, 40 dollars divided by one hour. This right over here\\nis 40 dollars per hour. You could view this as our\\nproportionality constant, $40 per hour, and you see that. Two hours, $80. 80 divided by two is 40. Three hours, $120. 120 divided by three is 40. Our proportionality constant is 40. That your earnings divided by hours is always going to be equal to 40, or you could say that your earnings is equal to, if you multiply\\nboth sides by hours, is going to be equal\\nto 40 times your hours. Your earnings in dollars\\nis going to be equal to 40 times your hours. '",147632,357,55,0,40,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,Yes

this is 7sp two seventh-grade statistics and probability standard 2 video 1 using data to draw inferences ok these down in your journals and define thoughts of the population in a random sampling that we had in a previous gonna be using our estimation skills in determining some answers to some pause the video and read through this saying okay it says that Jim has stocked his pond with some fish he put a hundred and twenty fish into this pond there are two different types and what we need to do is kind of estimate about how many of each type of fish Jim had put in there he had forgotten so skills some maybe some fraction work kind of reading a graph to see if there are any patterns that we might see any occurrences that happen within these numbers that can lead us to some type of couple of different ways that you can kind of break it down individually to see if we can get similar answers so look at the graph table as a whole alright well what do we know he has taken five five samples and then each of these samples in the net he has a bunch of fish and in sample one he has grabbed eight total fish sample two he has nine fish then he had ten fish in his net six and then three so if we were to add up all of the different samples and the total amount of fish that he has randomly taken out of this pond so he he took a one net full of fish he looked at them and then he put him back in so every time he took a sample he replaced it so that it would always be out of a hundred and twenty fish well if I were to add up all of the fish that were in these five samples we would have what 5 plus 6 is 11 plus 7 is 18 + 4 is 22 + 2 is 24 3 would be 27 30 33 35 and then one more would be 36 we have a total of 36 fish that were taken just concentrate on one type of fish add up the total amount in the 5 samples 11 18 22 24 it looks like there were 24 doing a little bit more than estimating in these samples but we can use that also since the data is right in front of us taking 24 / 36 and reducing it we find a number that goes into both evenly we can even adjust the fractions since little alteration to either the numerator or the denominator to find fractions that are so that we can reduce however this one happens to be reducible so 12 goes into 24 two times and 12 goes into 36 three times so the bluegill in the five samples represent two-thirds of the fish kind of plays out in a similar fashion for the largemouth bass alright so the bass 36 fish were taken and then we had what 3 6 9 11 12 out of the 36 that is also a fraction that can be reduced I reduce 12 goes into 12 one time and 12 goes into 36 3 times so we have one third of the fish being the bass the largemouth bass so do these fractions kind of add up well two-thirds and one-third is is 3/3 which is a whole all right now the actual question says based on that information how many of each type of fish would you predict her in the pond so if there are a hundred and twenty total fish and now I have my fractions my parts I can just do some quick multiplication so if I take my two thirds which are my blue gills and multiply by 120 fish I should be able to find out what two-thirds of a hundred twenty is now you can do your cross canceling here or you could multiply just do the straight across here so two times 12 is 24 with a zero and three fraction 3 goes into 240 well 3 goes into 24 eight times with a zero so we have bluegill the blue gills are 80 an estimated 80 of the fish well what would be left over if I have an 80 amounts for bluegill that would leave 40 of the bass and if you were to multiply one third of 120 so you would switch this out and put 1 third times 120 you would have ended up with a 40 over here so did we answer the question based on the data Jim collected how many of each type of fish would you predict are in the pond we did some actually we use some precise mathematics here based on the data the in a different fashion so let me clear bluegill right now we have five out of eight fish being the bluegill because we we have eight total fish five plus three is eight and five of them being bluegill we had five out of eight in sample two we have six out of nine six plus three is nine and six of them in the third sample we have seven out of ten the fourth is four out of six and the last sample was we can look at these fractions and see how many of them are close to each other looking at the reduced fraction on the far right here of two thirds well that kind of rings a bell from the last attempt that we made four over six can actually be reduced to two thirds and to six over nine and that reduces to 2/3 I think we can make our estimation right of eight is just over a half because four out of eight fish would have been 50% so we know that this is more than can estimate that 7 out of 10 is pretty close to 6 out of 9 if I were to make a little adjustment these fractions being very close to 2/3 two-thirds which ended up being as we gonna do the same idea with the largemouth bass take your focus down work here and see what happens all right so the first sample was three out of then we have what three out of nine three out of ten two out of six and then one out of three all right far right we have one third the next one can reduce to one third 3/9 also reduces to one third three eighths is very close to three ninths so that we can estimate to one third and then three tenths is very close to 3/9 which is also estimated to one third so we have just made our final judgment that the largemouth bass contained in the samples are approximately one third of the fish which would be forty of them okay I have a second example here a real-world and read through this a couple times sample of 50 students that were surveyed about who they would vote for in the school election twenty of these surveyed students said that they would vote for candidate a now estimate estimate how many students would vote for candidate a couple different ways that we can solve this one also the first thing that jumps into my mind is a proportion so why out of 50 students would vote for figure out the percentage of that by setting it equal to how about 100 to that whatever our answer is out of a hundred we can double that answer students all right so cross-product rule 50 multiplied by X is 50 X and that should be equal to 20 times a hundred 20 times a hundred we have 2 times 1 is 2 and then we have 3 coefficient of 50 so X should be equal to well 50 goes into 2,000 how many up this last zero here so 50 goes into 200 4 times with a zero at the end another way of doing that is cancel out these two zeros and just say how many times does 5 go into 200 well 5 goes into 20 four times with an extra zero so students there being 40 I can assume then out of 200 students we would have have to be 80 all right so 80 students approximately 80 students out of 200 would be voting there another way that we can solve this let me think here I have 50 students that were surveyed so we have 200 total students and this kind of reminds me of the last lesson in which we have a large population if students we took this smaller sample of 50 and then we were able to make a judgement on what that final amount of students are that would vote for candidate a so if I know that there are just say 50s we have 50 another 50 and I know that what in here about 20 of them would vote for candidate a in here if I were to do the same random sample we can assume that they all have 20 students so putting them all together 20 plus 20 is 40 plus 20 is 60 plus 20 is another 80 students and you can put that into a nice sentence like we work on in class okay air journal please define the given terms on page 2 of the flip chart write a few sentences on

fraction into a decimal using long division come on you know you love it go ahead have a seat stop cheering all right finish your little dance all right you a little bit of an example on how to think about what division is ok a division is sharing or putting into groups ok equal groups and when we do long division and we start using decimals what I want to do is I want you to continue to use this idea of sharing the long division on this ok so I brought along for friends tell me with to help us along with this all right so ones dimes and pennies because these are also representative of place value so this would be like the tens place the ones place the decimal would be here tenths and hundredths ok so as I think an easy way to represent this all right so if I have 82 dollars and fifty six cents and I want to share it with all and start passing them out and sharing eight ten dollar bills right four five say ok Chewbacca you get two of those c-3po you get two of those Yoda you get twenty dollars r2d2 you get 20 us oh and hey look I used all of them up right I use them all up so what does this look like when we actually divine right so in long division i have 82 dollars and it with four people and what I did is I just said eight ten dollar bills if I give each person two of them I use up all eight of them and I get none left ok place value the two are the ones place right and so this means i have to one dollar bills okay so if i have to one c-3po one and Yoda one will then r2 and Chewbacca are screaming about where group of five organize these a little going to group them together here and with the ones so I converted them into dimes ok and so then what am I going to people right and actually I should say here is I made a little bit of mistake I what I really have is I have this extra have an extra of five dimes ok from the actual problem so these are the two this going to take it out of the group so I can equally distribute these so I have twenty five dimes and I need to share these with these four characters so can just do one at a time right one oops 1 1 1 2 2 2 3333 now lets you know what this is going to of these so i can share for whoops is how many dimes to each of them have times here I have six times here and I have six times here so I can go ahead and share those for a second and then I can go ahead and put them in my groups one dime left ok I use six in each group and then I have another six pennies that I had to begin with right so I have one two three four five six pennies together trade in for one two three four five six seven eight nine ten pennies all right to share these which each of them well there are 16 pennies and for people so like using 16 which leaves none left I look and I say okay each of them should have twenty dollars and sixty four cents right 26 for 2064 2064 and 2064 and everybody is happy alright fraction what I want to do here is I want to use this fraction and divide to look and say 4/5 ok my numerator is smaller than my denominator so my answer here right my quotient is my quotient is going to be less than 1 okay a quotient my answer here is gonna be less than 1 if I have four things sharing with five people no one is going to get a whole thing live to look at this and I say is it look like this or is it look like this test so for 55 things sharing with four people everybody gets one and then part things I share with five people do I have enough no I have not enough but I going to turn this into 40 tenths will 540 tenths and I share with five people everyone can get eight tenths and then I use up 40 of them and none or left so my answer here is going to be eight tenths okay again this is where your multiplication tables and understanding your products for just single digit multiplication come in really really handy try another 19 twentieths okay again here my quotient is going to be less than 1 okay because nine is less the 20 parts 20 groups not each group will have a whole thing in it so is it tenths so 90 tenths broken up into 20 parts is going to be four parts each 80 of them i use up 80 i get 10 left 20 so I need to break that into hundredths a hundred hundredths broken each thing okay so five times 20 is 100 have none remaining my final answer here is going to be 0.45 okay so forty five hundredths alright is 9/20 take a look at this one this is negative 9/20 right well guess what we just found out that 9/20 is 0.45 so negative 9 x / 20 is just going to be negative 0.45 okay you can do it a lot of times see something that looks like this you do negative 9 and again you can just say my answer will be negative and then you solve it out like we just did alright 480 10 left over bring down the 0 to make it hundredths 100 hundreds divided 45 answer is negative 0.45 or negative one here once you go ahead pause the video and you try to do this one all right so what do I know about this one my quotient is going to be less than 1 so is it going to look like this or is it going to look like this okay well one going into three right 3/1 that would be work three goes into one if I have one can I share with three people I cannot I going to turn it into tents ten tenths divided into three groups that uses two hundredths one hundredths now gives me 10 hundredths 5 10 divided into three groups i use up three I have news of one so make that into thousands I have ten thousandths I give everybody three this this is just going to keep going right this is going to be zero point 3 333333 and on and on forever well in going to put this bar over at the top pattern okay the three is just going to repeat on and on and on forever and ever this video helped make sure you bring in ',382,2,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,Yes

this lesson you will learn how to add into rational numbers using a number line to if you wanted to add the number 2 plus 6 and you want to do this on the number by 6 and the number you reach is the sum you go to the right of the number line because numbers to the right of 0 get larger numbers to the left of 0 are negative and get increasingly negative as you continue on further left now know 16 and negative 4 so to add 16 plus negative 4 you would start at the number 16 and you would go to the left 4 negative 4 is the same thing as and the number you land on here is 12 number line to subtract subtraction means to take away and if you want to subtract on the number line you start at the first number and move left the just say we want to subtract 12 minus 8 you would start at the number 12 and then jump to the left 8 places the number that you land on is the difference so 12 minus 8 equals 4 now so what if I take away the 8 here and line as well now what if I want to subtract 12 minus negative 5 so how start at 12 I know that much the next step is minus means I would move to the left but then I have negative 5 and I remember that when I added a negative number I moved to the left instead of moving to the right so the negative sign kind of tells you to go in the opposite direction so if I go left for subtraction but then the negative sign tells me to go the opposite direction I end up adding essentially start at 12 and go to the right 5 places case and the number you land on here is equivalent to adding that number and subtraction sign tells you to go to the left on the number line but then then the negative sign tells you to go in the opposite direction from which you were going to go so you would have to end up going right and therefore you add now what if I take negative five and I make that the number I want to subtract from going to subtract away 12 so here I would start at negative five which is right here and I would count back right subtraction means go to the left and anything different so go to the left 12 places and see where I land I land on the number negative 17 so negative five minus 12 makes the difference increasingly negative so you get negative 17 here now I notice something positive 12 and negative 5 and what happens here when I said 12 minus negative 5 I got a difference of 17 and when I did negative 5 minus 12 again the same two numbers and subtracting I got a difference of negative 17 and if you notice if you take the absolute value of negative 17 you get positive 17 which is the answer that you get over here and the reason that this happens is because absolute value represents the distance between any two numbers on the number line and let me show you what I numbers negative 5 which is right here and positive 12 the distance between these two numbers on a number line is 17 and if you count this I assure you you will find that there are 17 places in between negative 5 and 12 so the absolute value represents the distance between any two numbers on a number line with a fresh number line what if I want to add the number 8 plus gonna start at the number 8 on the number line and normally when you add you would go to the right however you see the negative sign here which means you need to go in the opposite direction or you need to subtract actually so 8 plus negative 8 is the same thing as 8 minus 8 so if we jump back by 8 here and 5 6 7 8 so I jumped back by 8 the number I land on is zero so 8 plus negative 8 equals 0 what you learn from this is that 8 and negative 8 are opposite numbers and opposite numbers have the sum of opposite numbers you always get 0 so you can you can do this any number if you had negative 4 plus 4 right same value opposite sign the sum would be 0 if you had the negative number second again same value opposite sign you will problem together meg has $5 she owes her friend 2 dollars how much will Meg have left after she pays her friend back in this situation we need to figure out the integers that represent both dollar amounts so if meg has 5 dollars that would be represented by a positive integer so positive 5 if she owes her friend some money and she needs to pay her friend back that means you have to use a negative sign for this 2 dollars right after she pays the money back and to do that you would have 5 plus negative 2 so start at the number 5 on the number line jumped back twice and this represents minus two or plus negative two and the number you land on is positive three so that means that after she pays her friend back meg will still have three dollars thanks for watching ',1257,5,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,Yes

about how to solve two-step equations as we learned earlier equations are statements of mathematical facts in which you are using an equal sign so that is the definition of an equation alrights a statement of two expressions being written with an equal sign an expression however is a statement of variables constants and coefficients that do not have an equal sign so the equation has an equal sign expressions do not know equal sign R is present all right so if an equation is a statement of fact we use an equal sign to say that this number whatever this number is is the for example this number seven well this number has to be seven let me give you another example so you have two a plus four equals nine so whatever this number is it has to be equal to nine so two a plus four is the same number when everything gets gets figured out the statement that this is the reason why I use an equal sign okay all right figure out how do we solve two-step have 4x minus five equals three the first thing that we need to figure out is you want to get just the variable by itself so you want to isolate solve for just this you want to solve for X so this statement reads four times some gives me the same number as 3 all right so I have to figure out a value for x that will make the equation true the goal for solving algebra solving algebraic equations is to figure out a trying to find that will make the equation true alright that is the goal on the other thing that we have to think about is we then want to get all the coefficients coefficients are numbers that multiply multiplication happening between this you have this minus five which is a constant and you also have a three over here which is a constant as well constants are just numbers negative five will always be negative five three will always be three okay so you want to get all of the coefficients and the constants on one side of the equation and just the variable a trying to solve for on the on the other side all right an interesting thing happens whenever you actually move a constant coefficient or variable from one side of the equation to the other you actually have to take the opposite the inverse operation when it changes sides and now all right so to solve this equation 4x minus 5 equals 3 I first want to I want to keep 4x I guess by itself I want to get this negative 5 off this side so in order to get rid of it I have to add the inverse of negative 5 well the inverse of negative 5 is a positive 5 so if I do that to this number I have to do it to this number as well because this number is the same as this number have a mathematical sense of why the short way works all right so these will cancel out because the inverse property of addition when you add a number to its opposite you make 0 for X plus 0 gives me 4x because the identity property of addition all right so 4x is left on this side equals 3 plus 5 3 + 5 is 8 so I now have 4x equals 8 well 4 times what number will give me 8 well to get rid of this with respect to reciprocal the inverse of multiplying by 4 the inverse of multiplying by 4 is dividing by 4 or multiplying by the multiply both sides by 1/4 and the 4s the inverse property of multiplication multiply a number by typical to make one and all of this is 1 times 1 is 1 1 invisible coefficient in front of that is 1 and then I am multiplying 8 by 1/4 all that simply means is divide 8 by 4 you get 2 and then multiply that by 1 and you get 2 over 1 and you get 2 all yet we have to plug it in and make sure that the answer makes sense so take 2 and plug it back into the original equation if you actually get 3 you want the answer of 3 then the X is correct so 4 X means 4 times X so 4 X is 4 times 2 5 should give me 3 all right use order of operations no groups no exponents multiplication division yes let me do that first and copy everything else 4 times 2 8 multiplication division no addition subtraction yes let me do that next and I get 3 if this is the same answer as this then X does equal 2 all do this because you actually are using the Equality properties in other words if I add a number to this number to this side I have to add the same number to both these numbers are the same number because using the equal sign if I multiply a number by 1/4 on find them multiply this entire number by 1/4 I have to multiply this entire number by 1/4 as well because they have call the Equality property of of the shorter way basically we recall the fact that once a number moves sides on the equation you take the opposite or with this 3 instead of taking 3 instead to do the inverse operations now instead 5 to 3 so the new equation would be 4x equals 3 plus 5 which is 8 and now this 5 is gone the quick way because if I added a 5 to this it would cancel out and make 0 alright so 4x equals 8 next I instead of by the reciprocal of 4 which is 1/4 so X then equals the new equation is x times back in and see if it works 4 times 2 is 8 minus 5 is 3 this checks out all right so X the value that makes this equation true for X is 2 x equals 2 all right let us do another problem let us do it the longer way just so you see why the shorter way actually works all right so I have 6x plus 9 equals 20 I want to get the variable by itself so operation to get rid of this 9 on this going to add a negative 9 to this number left on this side this makes 0 equals 20 minus 9 11 all right then to divide X by 6 a or multiply by 1/6 so multiply then 11 times 1 equals 11 all over 6 the answer that makes this true getting whole numbers all the time but rational number as opposed to simply a whole number so a number that looks like a fraction of course we know though that whole numbers can be written as fractions it actually makes sense so the equation should read on my check 6 times whatever is 11 divided by 1 is 11 Plus 9 is 20 so yes the Miss number that makes this true is eleven-sixths all right take 9 away from 20 so 6x equals 20 going to multiply by the inverse or reciprocal of 6 which is 1/6 so X the new equation to solve this would be x equals 11 times 1/6 and then 11 times 1 is 11 all over 6 x equals 11 sixths okay and we showed our check on the other example we have one more problem to go we have 4 X minus 7 equals 19 you might want to pause the video and see if you can solve this problem on your own and then come back and unpause it when the correct answer and did the proper steps the way you should have and checked your answer as well okay all not by itself so I have to get it by operations to get rid of numbers to get X by itself all right instead of taking 7 away from equals 19 plus 7 26 so I have 4x equals going to multiply 26 by the reciprocal of 4 which is 1/4 so the new equation will be x equals 26 times 1/4 now the variable is by itself on one side and cancel yes I can I get a 2 there pull out a factor 2 from 26 and I get 13 so I get 13 times 1 equals 13 all over 2 so the answer I get see if this is actually correct in my check 4 times 4 X means 4 times so 4 times X I say is 13 halves minus 7 equals 19 if this is true then the answer is correct for X being 13 halves all right can I fractions yes so I pull out a factor of 2 all right so now I have 2 times 13 gives me twenty six and now 26 divided by one is 26 26 - and 7 is 9 1 minus 0 is 1 yes it does the answer is correct x equals 13 halves hope you enjoyed this presentation on solving two-step equations and that it made your understanding of solving equations a bit easier and more simple thank you and take care

this lesson you will learn how to evaluate expressions that involve multiplication and division of rational numbers and this will include both positive and negative integers as well as fractions so anytime that you have multi operation expressions you need to remember the proper order of operations and to remember the order of operations you can use the acronym PEMDAS and this represents the order in which you need to solve so the first priority is to solve anything in parentheses first so evaluating all exponents is your next step then you have multiplication and you have addition subtraction so if you just are dealing with multiplication and multiply you solve from left to right as the operations appear so if division is the first thing on the left you would divide first and vice versa is true if multiplication appeared first on the left the same thing goes for addition respect to these two operations you just solve from left to right as they appear on the left and this is the first problem I see multiplication division and fractions and fractions are the same at multiplication and division and you those two so solve from left to right looking at the left I see that there is a multiplication expression in the new numerator there and you keep it over denominator and now you have divided by negative 24 over 2 now see if you can simplify both or one of these fractions take a look at 48 over 5 there is no common factor besides 1 between the be working with this fraction which is a little ugly but hopefully it clears up got negative 24 and 2 and this is where I want to talk a little bit about sine so pause on the problem two positive numbers and this applies for multiplication and division two positive numbers the answer is always positive so if you take a positive number divided by a positive number your quotient is positive or if you multiply two positive numbers your product is also positive if you have two negative numbers the answer will be net sorry will be positive and lastly if you have a mix of positive negative a positive number divided by negative or positive times negative the outcome is always negative so keep that were in the problem we have negative twenty-four over two and this is the same thing as negative 24 divided by two first just think about the numbers and then think about the sign if you divide 24 by two the answer is 12 now think about the sign you have negative 24 divided by positive two so this is positive divided by negative the outcome is negative so your answer here is 48 over five divided by negative 12 now to divide this fraction by this whole number is a little tricky and let me just pull down some some paper here and instead is multiply by the reciprocal dividing by a number is the same thing as multiplying by its reciprocal so to do that recognize that negative 12 can be written as a fraction as negative 12 over 1 the reciprocal of that is you flip around the numerator in the denominator so you get 1 over negative 12 this is the reciprocal of negative 12 it you have 48 divided by 5 times the reciprocal of negative 12 which is negative 1/12 now I put the negative negative 1 over 12 is the same solving multiply the fractions by finding the product of the numerators so also again you have positive times negative the answer is gonna be negative so you get negative 48 on top and on the bottom you have 5 times 12 which is a product of 60 so you get 60 on the bottom both of these numbers are divisible by 12 so if we divide negative 48 by 12 you get negative 4 and positive 60 divided by 12 is 5 so this simplifies down to negative 4/5 and you can write this as negative 4 over 5 or 4 over negative 5 these answers are the same have solved this problem and it actually helps simplify things a little bit and let me show you that one so to make a little bit more space I want to go back to this step right here here you have 48 over 5 times negative 1 over 12 if I notice here that the numerator and the denominator share a common factor from and multiply the two denominators and multiply the two numerators I can start simplifying right here because I know that this is gonna end up in the numerator and this factor is gonna end up in the denominator and I can simplify those ahead of time so what happens if I divide both these numbers at this point gonna cross that out and put a 4 there and 12 divided by 12 is 1 so that leaves 1 in the numerator here so now I have 4 over 5 times negative 1 over 1 now multiply the two numerators and you get 4 times negative 1 which equals negative 4 and multiply the two denominators you have 5 times 1 which is 5 and look there we got the same answer that we got when we multiplied through then simplified and this is something you can do when you notice that the numerator of one fraction shares a common factor with the denominator of another fraction they have to be on opposite sides of the fraction to be able to simplify this

ns1 a this is seventh-grade the number system part one with a sub part a standards the Common Core State Standards with all of the words that they have in there and try to explain what the standard is trying to tell you in this part we are going to be talking about the number line a lots and integers on the number line and how we are able to use the idea of opposites to combine those quantities to make a zero you to know please pause the video take out your journals and define them as best as you can here is a picture of a number line diagram you are very familiar with the number line I am going to discuss the sides of zero we have the right side of zero and the left side of zero obviously the right side of zero the numbers are increasing in size which means they are getting larger those are called the positive numbers and then the center is called the origin or zero and as we move to the left which is what much of the standard is the negative numbers and as you see even though they are increasing in number size from right to left in reality those numbers are getting smaller and smaller the farther away you go from zero so on the right side of zero the farther away you go from zero the numbers get bigger and on the left side of zero the farther away smaller how are we going to compare them on a number line if I were to say what is negative three compared to negative ten and when use comparisons they want you to use the than or equal to or greater than or equal to depending upon what the numbers are given to you and when I teach this I looking at negative 3 and negative 10 the negative to me means I lost money gone so I lost three dollars or I lost ten dollars well what would you rather do would you rather lose three dollars want to lose anything but if it were to happen which one would you rather lose I dollars so the symbol replaced here would have to be greater than so negative three is greater than negative ten look at your number line diagram negative 3 is located pretty close to the zero and negative 10 is located all the way over here to the left which means as we go left these numbers are decreasing in size so negative 3 is greater than negative 10 how about 5 and negative 1 5 is like saying 5 dollars I have 5 dollars in my pocket my friend lost a dollar so would you rather have five dollars or lose a dollar I would rather have five dollars so five is greater than negative one take it to the zero or your origin as you go to the right of zero the numbers are larger and as you go to the left they get smaller so five located all the way here on the right would have to be greater than negative one who sits to the left of zero how about negative 3 and positive 3 same situation you could go right to the number line and think of the rules I gave you previously in this video and say ok negative 3 is to the left of 0 and positive 3 is to the right of 0 so than or think of it in terms of money like I mentioned would you rather lose three dollars or would you rather have three dollars I think we all would talk about opposites the standard is really emphasizing this word opposite and they want you to understand that zero is the main player of opposites an opposite is a number that is the same distance from 0 but on opposite sides of 0 let me grab that number line from the previous page just get rid of this for you and make the number line the main focus here so if I were to see 0 right here in the center and just pick out a random number like 4 so if I put a little arrow here by for an opposite is basically the number of units away from 0 1 2 3 4 but on the opposite side of 0 negative 1 negative 2 negative 3 negative 4 so this is the opposite of 4 so very quickly tell me what the opposite of negative 9 is units away from zero one two three four five six seven eight nine so one two three four five six seven eight nine so positive nine is the opposite of negative nine and if I were to put them together where are we gonna land if I gonna land right here at zero so negative nine added two positive nine is equal to zero and this is the main part of the standard today I have a real-world situation that we might be gonna kind of describe a little bit about the game of golf so this example makes sense you in golf par is the expected number of strokes to finish a hole your score for the game is the sum of your number of strokes above or below par the player with the least score is common for me what will get me back to even par how am I gonna get back to zero so I start on the first hole of my game look at that on our golf course so here need to get maybe I could draw a little I need to get right in that hole and I here the idea of golf they say that the average player should be able to hit their golf ball into this hole in four going to look mr. Wirtz has his driver gonna hit the ball with his driver out he lands right about there so that was get as close to this red pin as possible around the bend here and lands it right about there there shot number two and if he was really good this mr. woods guy he would take another club and he would hit the ball onto the green and it would probably bounce and roll right about there that is shot number three and he takes out a putter and he knocks the ball into the hole and that is what we call par I was able to get from the tee box to the pin in the hole in four shots that was par unfortunately mr. Wirtz has a lot of excuses when he plays golf as do many other golfers that we know I believe when I played on this day we had a very large wind drawing that flag back it was very very windy you can see the flag is blowing straight up and when mr. Wirtz went from the tee box he hit his first ball and it really faded over not gonna be able to get a lot of loft on his next shot that was shot number liner out from the trees and it landed right about there so that was his second next shot remember it was very windy so he was going for the green in in his next shot however he landed into the sand and that was his third and shot mr. will just be honest about that he actually took his next shot and shot it over the green for four he pitched on to the green for five he missed the the hole and then he putted in to the hole on his sixth shot well if this is a par four and it took him six shots to do it what would you say that was in terms of par you would say that that was plus 2 over par so after the first hole instead of being 0 or under 0 or - strokes I am really struggling on this course and I par on the second hole if I go to hole number 2 now what am I gonna have to do miraculously to get from a - over 0 back to zero down here on the bottom I have that situation on the first hole on hole number one I was to over and on gonna have to do two less than that to get back to where I started so positive to add it to negative two is equal to you tonight in your journal on page two of the flip chart write a few sentences on what you learned from this video and I would also like you in your journal to describe one real-world situation in which opposite quantities combine to make zero kind of like I did with the golf example and also be ready to share your example with the class see you all tomorrow ',1220,9,3,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,Yes

this lesson you will learn how to make predictions and inferences based problem Jackson school is having a party for six hundred six graders and four hundred seventh graders the school is buying lunch for both grades to celebrate the options for lunch are either pizza or hamburgers miss Johnson surveyed a group of sixth graders and seventh graders on which food they were would prefer below in this table you have the summary of the results that she got from that random you know she just sampled randomly and you might recall that you can have a small random sample of a population in this case the pop the entire population would be all of the sixth graders and all of the seventh graders but instead she takes a small random group of both grades in order to make inferences about questions about it so below I have the questions now we want to know first which food should miss Johnson buy for around and ask every single sixth grader in every single seventh grader so what she did was took a small sampling and as you can see here from the number of results in sixth grade right the total number of students she asked was sixty and over here in seventh grade she asked 20 plus 35 or 55 seventh graders what they would prefer so now forty students answered that they would prefer pizza for their celebration lunch and twenty students replied they would like hamburgers so since more people want pizza she can make the inference that the entire grade would most likely prefer pizza over and see what happens when you go to the seventh graders in seventh grade twenty students want pizza however thirty-five students want hamburgers so for seventh grade she should order hamburgers so seventh will be hamburgers and again this is getting a rough idea of what the entire take a look at this second question here and I want to make some more space for rear in the total class number so there are 600 sixth graders and 400 seventh mind as we solved the second problem so the second problem says if Miss Johnson could buy both pizza and hamburgers for both grades how many pieces of pizza and hamburgers should you buy for sixth get some amount of pizza and some number of hamburgers and that will cover the population of the sixth graders so now to do this what you need to do is make an inference based off of the data which infer what you should do for the entire you can see here forty students like pizza and again let me just remind you that the total here was 60 right 40 plus population so if 40 of those 60 prefer a percentage so 40 over 60 reduces to the fraction two-thirds ultimately right and two-thirds can be converted to the percentage sixty six point six six repeating that would repeat percent or you can just round this to 67 percent now what you need to do is since about two-thirds of the random sampling wanted pizza find out what is two-thirds of the entire population so two-thirds of 600 that of means to multiply so two-thirds of 600 is two-thirds times 600 now you multiply the numerator by the whole number so you get the fraction 1200 over three when you divide 1200 by three you get 400 should buy enough for 400 students now many hamburgers chic by doing subtraction right if you know do this in green the total number of students is six hundred four hundred students should get pizza so subtract hundred hamburgers for the remainder remaining students so this would be two hundred hamburgers and four hundred pizzas now if you wanted to focus on hamburgers first you could have done this differently so let me just remove could have done it by just looking at the number of students who liked looking at twenty students out of sixty who want hamburgers right so you would write this as a fraction twenty out of sixty prefer hamburgers now when you reduce this fraction you get down to the simplified fraction of 1/3 now one-third can be written as the percentage thirty three point three three three and this would repeat so thirty three point three percent and you can round that to thirty three percent so now you need to find one-third or thirty three percent of the total sixth-grade population so now what you would do is you remember the total population is six hundred and to find one-third of 600 you multiply 1/3 times 600 multiply the numerator by 600 and then you get the fraction 600 over three when you do this division you get the value of 200 which is the same thing that we did when we originally found the value for pizza and then use subtraction make predictions and inferences based off of data thanks for watching

all right now how many total see two plus three is five and five plus two is seven so this would be two out of seven three out of seven two out of M&Ms one to red M&Ms out of how many total one two three four five six seven you solve probability questions when you are given some information and you need to figure out what the probability of the answer is to be close to one this is closer to 0-7 so the probability of this happening if I did the experiment seven times would be probably two times this actually happening with me picking out a red M&M really cool experiment for you to try take a bag of M&Ms and put a certain number inside maybe you might want to take these put them inside a bag that give and the M&Ms an equal chance of being picked I just remembered that we this was a very simple problem and I probability of picking a red or a green sorry a red or a blue M&M okay so if the or a blue mm all right so what you would that to the number of blue all right when you see or typically means to add with probability and then blue is 2/7 so you add 2/7 and 2/7 and they have the seven the number of total possible outcomes are seven and the number of chances to get red is two and the number of chances of blue are two so two plus two is four and you get four sevens as your answer think that the answer is changing the problem and you get the incorrect answer so probability whenever you see probability of red or number of red add up the number of blue the total possible outcomes and looking at our tree diagram it helps you to understand it ',22363,9,2,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Yes

That is, a change\\nof one unit in x corresponds to a change\\nof 0.4 units in y. And they also ask\\nus to figure out what the equation of\\nthis line actually is. So let me get my scratch pad\\nout and we could think about it. that means that y is going to be\\nequal to some constant times x. So if we have a\\nproportional relationship, So the point 0, 0\\nshould be on your line. So if this is the point 0, 0,\\nthis should be on my line right over there. So if x goes from 0\\nto 1, we already know that a change of 1\\nunit in x corresponds to a change of 0.4 units in y. So if x increases by 1, then\\ny is going to increase by 0.4. The 0.4 is hard to graph on this\\nlittle tool right over here. So then when x\\nincreases another 1, y is going to\\nincrease by 0.4 again. When x increases\\nagain by 1, then y is going to increase\\nby 0.4 again. If x increases again, y is\\ngoing to increase by 0.4 again. So just to 1.6. Notice, every time x\\nis increasing by 1, y is increasing by 0.4. Now, if x increases\\nby 1 again to 5, then y is going to\\nincrease 0.4 to 2. And I like this point because\\nthis is nice and easy to graph. So we see that the point 0,\\n0 and the point 5 comma 2 should be on this graph. And I could draw it. And notice the slope of\\nthis actual graph over here. Notice the slope of\\nthis actual graph. If our change in x is 5. So notice, here our\\nchange in x is 5. Our change in x is 5. You see that as well. When you go from 0 to 5,\\nthis change in x is 5. Change in x is equal to 5. What was our\\ncorresponding change in y? Well, our corresponding change\\nin y when our change in x was 5, our change\\nin y was equal to 2. And you see that here,\\nwhen x went from 0 to 5, y went from 0 to 2. So our change in y in this\\ncircumstance is equal to 2. So our slope, which\\nis change in y over change in x, is\\nthe rate of change of your vertical\\naxis with respect to your horizontal axis, is\\ngoing to be equal to 2 over 5, or 2/5. Which if you wrote it as\\na decimal is equal to 0.4. So this right over\\nhere is your slope. the equation of this\\nline is going to be. Well, we know that y is equal\\nto some constant times x. And we know that\\nthe point 5, 2 is on this line right over here. So we could say, well, when x\\nis equal to 5, y is equal to 2. Or, when y equals 2, we\\nhave k times 5, or k is Which makes sense. When we have y is equal\\nto something times x, this something right over\\nhere is going to be our slope. So the equation of the\\nline is y is equal to 0.4x. So we had two points,\\none was the point 0, 0. When x is 0, y is 0. And when x is 5, y\\nis 0.4 times that. And we said the equation is\\ny is equal to 0.4 times x.

some starter examples then do some about how to use these in the real world variable by itself on one side of the equation like x equals and to do that think of addition and subtraction as opposites and multiplication and division as opposites and the key here really and this is what you get used to after you do several of these problems is to pick an order that makes it easier for you okay so sometimes in a two-step step before the other then the opposite order and then always check your answers to first example here alright so we have this equation 3x plus 2 equals 23 we want to get the variable by itself we question here really is what order which would we do first you could divide everything by 3 to get rid of this 3 because then 3 divided by 3 would be so you have 2/3 and this 23 so you have fractions not the end of the world but maybe we should try the other way first being added so we can subtract from both from both sides on the left-hand side here to a plus 2 minus 2 is just gonna multiplying by the X so we do the opposite which is to divide and we have to do that to both sides of course on the left hand side and this is really critically important this 3 divided by 3 we say those cancel what we really mean is that 3 divided by 3 equals 1 so you you just write it as and then 21/3 on the right hand side is seven so we have x equals seven so now the variable by itself on one side but we always want to check the answer so 23 so we can go ahead and say yep we answer then this one with negative numbers so similarly here you can start to get a sense of what order might work best you numbers you could divide by negative 2 that would actually work out a little bit better because both of these are even numbers and so dividing by a 2 would not give you a fraction but we can also do as we did up here get rid of subtracted from our variable so we want to do the opposite which is at just add 14 to both sides and on the left-hand because minus 14 plus 14 is 0 and on the so now we have negative 2b equals negative 10 and now that negative 2 is do the opposite divided by negative 2 both sides on the left-hand side we have just one B or B and on the right hand side negative 10 divided by negative 2 check this problem again so 5 or so check the solution if we put that in for B here in our original equation we have negative 2 times 5 would be negative 10 minus 14 would be yep negative 24 so we couple of harder problems over here so take an extra step in one one and the real question is should we distribute or so you might take a look at this problem say well 3 times the quantity G + 2 equals 12 the best thing to do is to go ahead and distribute this 3 to the G and 3 times G is 3 G plus 2 3 x plus 2 is six plus six and then that will equal 12 distributing here to this equation here now this looks very similar to this one with 3G on the left and 12 minus 6 is 6 then we can divide both sides by 3 again the hang of this now and then you have just G and then 6 divided by 3 on the right hand side is 2 so you have G answer if we have G equals 2 here and we put it in our original equation 2 plus 2 is 4 multiplied by 3 answer now notice though that you actually went step there is a faster way to do this can you think what it might be well this 3 is being multiplied by G Plus 2 so what if we did the opposite what if we went ahead and divided both sides by 3 okay so what would happen here this 3 divided by 3 would just be 1 so we just have one of these quantities so we just write it as G plus 2 and then 2 on the left hand side and 4 on the really close to being solved already we just have to get rid of this plus 2 by doing the opposite subtract 2 and then we have G equals 4 minus 2 which is just 2 so you can see we got the exact same answer either way the only difference is here we did 2 steps on the right hand side we divided and then we subtracted so when you can find a shorter way to get to the answer the problem as long as more harder example here so here we have h plus 11 all divided by 8 equals 2 so divided by 8 so you might think ok well do that because both the H and the 11 to subtract 11 8 so after you put the eights fractions and that can be a little bit more difficult not to make a mistake so probably the better thing to get rid of want to do the opposite by multiplying that so a lot on the left hand side here gonna cancel meaning 8 divided by 8 is plus 11 on the left hand side and then on the right hand side 2 times 8 is 16 very close again that 11 is being added on the right hand side 16 minus 11 is 5 answer to make sure in our original equation so 5 forget these multiplying original equation 5 plus 11 is 16 divided by 8 does that equal to yep it gotten the correct answer there all strategies here first use a variable for the unknown you have to figure out what a variable and then look for starting values ending values and rates of change what do we mean by all this Malik get got a $200 cafe gift card on January 1st costs $5 each at the end of January drinks did Malik buy in January okay lot of numbers and words in here so you might be having trouble making sense of a lot of times we can find the unknown by looking for a question problem how many drinks did Malik buy in is the number of drinks okay now remember our other strategies here we want starting values ending values and rates of change so what was our starting there was $200 how much the gift card that down and that was what was our change now when we say rate of change we mean for each thing that happens like each drink that spot we want to know how much the balance on the gift card changes and you can see that from right here we can see the rate of change is five so we can write that as well okay into an equation that tells the story of what happens so we can always start with the starting value of 200 and we know we ended up with the ending value of 125 and then something happened in there we were moving from this larger value of 200 to the smaller value of 125 and something between the 5 and the D was happening what was that well if you think about it for each drink we subtract five dollars from the 200 so five D if you think about if we put one in for D that would be minus five dollars off if there were two drinks two in for D that would be minus ten off etc so this gives us the story of what happened it started with 200 minus 5 for ahead and rearrange this equation so that we have the variable as the first term kind of like in our examples that and write that as negative 5d plus 200 equals 125 so this was really the hard part is getting from all these words to an equation that we can recognize and we can we know we can work with just like so now we want to get D by itself and do that you could do it either way minus 5d because that plus 200 - 200 is just zero and on the right hand side 120 five minus 200 a little mental math okay now the negative five is multiplying by D we want to do the and we have to do that to both sides the left-hand side negative 5 divided by be 1 so one D and the negative 75 divided by 5 might have to dig into your times tables for that or use a gonna be positive 15 so here we have it should say D there D equals 15 so now equation that we came up with here so of D equals 15 we have negative 5 times D or negative 5 times 15 so that would be 7 negative 75 as we know from our math over here negative 75 plus 200 does that equal 125 yes so we know that the variable here should say D here again right here is equal to 15 but what does that mean well it means that the answer to our question how many drinks did malikbhai in January well he bought 15 two-step equations in the real world

at adding together integers an integer is defined as either a negative or a positive whole number so as you can see from the number line here we have starting with zero which is neither positive nor negative and to the right on the number line we simply count one two if we wanted to then to the left in the opposite direction things are continuously going to get smaller so we go to negative 3 negative 4 and so on something I want to call your attention to is the fact that the numbers themselves do seem to grow from the middle to the right it goes 1 2 3 4 to the left it goes 1 2 3 4 key word going to come up later where magnitude would be something to find as the distance from zero which is going to be the same whether the numbers positive or negative and that is going to be take a look at is adding two simple integers together negative 5 and 9 and always have to start at 0 in fact simplest way to go is go ahead and just start with the first number that you see a negative 5 right here like when you were learning about how to add whole numbers or natural numbers together we can do this addition by hops times one two three four five six seven eight nine so right here is where the answer is going to be but what number is that well go back to what we drew on our prior number line until we get to zero getting small or even though they really are getting bigger the magnitude is getting smaller and then once we hit zero well it just keeps getting more and a look here negative five after negative five is going to be negative four negative three negative two negative one start on positive we have positive 1 positive 2 positive 3 and positive 4 negative 5 plus 9 is 4 a positive form going to do negative 8 plus negative 4 negative 8 kind of in the middle here remember when you were learning about using the number line to do addition and subtraction you would remember that subtraction you always go to the left in addition you always go to the right well growing negatives in to the end of the equation here is to remember that subtracting change the direction of to the left but you see a negative going to go to them to the right and if you were going to go to the right when you see a negative number instead of the left so our operation that we see here is addition normally when you see addition but what kind of number were you adding 4 and negative 4 being a negative number instead of going to the right like left with negative numbers zero is something way over here here was negative 1 2 3 4 and so on over here so negative 11 and negative 12 is 4 hops to the left of negative 8 negative 8 plus negative 4 is negative 12 what about you but drawing a number line for every single problem that I could possibly have to do is going to get a little rule when it comes to addition and subtraction if the numbers are the same together you are just going to add the two numbers together and keep the sign that both numbers have for example we have a positive 2 and a positive 3 add them together well 2 plus 3 is 5 keep the sign positive positive positive 5 or negative 3 plus negative 5 they to add them together three plus five is negative the answer is negative eight integers with the same sign now if you have a different sign this is where you got to put a little bit of thought into sign of the larger of the two numbers and if you remember me giving you the the sign of the number that has the larger magnitude I know a big word but really all it means is the number that looks to be the biggest for instance here we have negative 5 and negative 3 if you simply had the numbers well since 5 has a negative in front of it our final answer is going to have a negative in front of it and the subtraction or difference between 5 & 3 5 minus 3 is 2 so we know the answer is a negative 2 keeping the sign of the number with the larger magnitude or the one that is the larger of the two numbers being 5 and a similar problem here we have 9 and negative 2 well we already know that 9 minus 2 is going to be 7 so I know off the bat before I even look here that the answer is going to be some kind of 7 so you look at the bigger 9 or 2 9 is bigger and since 9 is positive our final answer is positive so having to draw a number line every single time we add to these guys together and boy am I glad of that do you really feel like doing 38 or 24 hops going to do subtraction by hand I like to go ahead and stack them vertically 38 minus 24 8 minus 4 is 4 3 minus 1 is 2 I know the answer is going to be some kind of 14 but what kind of 14 is it is it a you we have a 38 and a 24 if you saw just a 28 excuse me a 24 and a 38 which one do you think is bigger 38 bigger and final answer is positive 38 plus negative 24 positive 14 apply that same rule in this scenario we have negative 65 and negative 23 are the signs the same or are they different this is a negative 65 so according to our rule we know that going to be a negative answer and then all we got to do is add the two numbers together to do it vertically five plus three is eight six plus two is eight the answer is negative 88 our next example is negative 56 plus 87 are the signs the same or different the bigger number well ignoring the sign 87 is a bigger number than 56 or 87 has a larger magnitude than negative 56 and since 87 is a positive number we know that the answer is going to be positive sometimes I like to go ahead and just put a little reminder to myself to remember what the sign of the final answer is going to be and since we know that 87 is the bigger one on top 7 minus 6 is 1 5 8 minus 5 is 3 we know the answer is a positive 31 rid of that plus sign so we can just say go ahead and treat this within a scenario a word problem a soccer team raised five hundred eighty-five dollars for the upcoming season they had to spend two hundred seventy-five dollars on new jerseys use integer addition to find how much money they have remaining so two things happened they earned money and they spent money when you earn money introduced into your bank account we are going to have a positive five hundred eighty-five dollars but they had to spend money when you spend money well money is being taking out so this is a negative 275 and since the word problem asks us to use integer addition to do numbers together now I think we both realize that we could have written this problem down as simply 585 - 275 but within the confines of this problem and to reinforce the idea of integer addition first step are the signs the same are the larger looking one is going to be the one whose sign we keep we have 585 of some kind and we have a 275 of some just put a little plus sign there to this vertically 585 - 275 5 minus 5 is 0 positive 310 or to put this back into the context of the problem it is a integers [Music] ',7,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,No

very good so in there a term is just separated by a plus or a minus so we have to multiply draw some arrows to make sense we have to multiply the 5 times the T and then ahead and write that so we have 5 times the T plus 5 times the 2 does that make sense yeah okay and so what is 5 times T simplify it to that yeah very good ok so one we have to remember that there are positive and negatives here so actually different ways so here we have a negative 3 times the quantity negative distribute it so tell me if this looks right yeah okay so that negative 3 is multiplying by the first time with term multiplying that by the next term which is 7 and the really critical thing here between because there was a plus sign up above and we just carried that plus sign negative 3 times negative 2x and negative times negative 6x positive 6x and how about that negative 3 times 7 negative 21 negative 21 so then what we have is really 6x minus 21 because we have here the plus a negative 21 which is just like minus 21 right right okay so you can see this one gets a little complicated with negatives and positives but the key thing is to remember that arrow whatever is that the addition of subtraction inside the parentheses you have to make sure and carry that forward or pay attention to was slightly different and do it here on negative three times the quantity negative 2x minus seven instead of plus seven okay so tell me what I should write here okay so negative three times negative 2x is 6x uh-huh and negative three times negative seven uh-huh is plus twenty-one okay good so you you kind of did a whole bunch of steps in your mind at the same once you get good at the distributive property you can just write this as 6x this so negative 3 times a negative two x and then minus a negative 3 times 7 does that make sense yeah okay you could have also said plus a negative 3 times negative seven okay just as long as positive and negatives and addition and subtraction correctly so now as you said that first term is going to be 6x and that second term is going to be a positive 21 so you can see that these problems are slightly different because we had a different addition or subtraction symbol inside the parenthesis makes sense yes okay distributing this so what would be 1/3 have to do there well so we distribute the 1/3 okay does it look like that yeah okay so 1/3 times 9a - remember that minus 1/3 times 6 ok now we can multiply times 9a 9/3 minus two does that look right yeah excellent ok factoring over here in the middle of the page so factoring is kind of like the with this same exact example that we had over here on the left hand side 5t plus know that that was the same as 5 times the quantity T plus 2 okay okay okay and plus 10 up to that five times the quantity t plus 2 and the way that we do that is we find the greatest common be factoring so we have 5t and we have greatest number that does right okay so we can say the greatest common factor of those two terms is 5 and then what we can do is we can say well we know sort of expression that looks like this factor out the 5 out of the 5t what do we have left t t good and if we factor the 5 out of the 10 what do we have left - so can we write this like 5 times the quantity t + - yeah okay so basically direction here to go this direction to get from 5t + 10 get the greatest common factor and turn it into 5 times the quantity t + 2 just went in the opposite another quick example here so we have 56 K - 32 so what was the first step that this find the greatest common factor okay good so what would be the greatest common factor between 56 K and 32 8 good now you could have said to write but greatest factor even four goes into both factor the greatest factor is eight so we look what if we factor that 8 out of 56 K what will we have there how many times does 8 go into 56 K 7k good and how about it out of that - 32 4 ok so well it looked like this eight times the quantities 7k minus four yeah okay very good and if we were to apply the distributive property here just to check you say okay 8 times 7 K 56 K 8 times -4 minus 32 okay all right now combining like terms so like terms are terms with the same variables to the see what that means so 3x and 5x well if like terms we can put them together right so they are like terms how about this one 4p squared and 2p are those like terms not is why is P squared and the other is just P okay perfect so up here in our definition we said they had to be to the same power these are to a different power this is P to the one even though the second power so those are not like and negative 4 XY squared are those like terms yeah yeah they are because they both have the same variables to the same power and that is XY squared so these are like terms and what we can do is we can combine like terms 5x you already said is a X 8x right okay how about this one 3x minus 5x minus 2x minus 2x gets and negative numbers how about this one 5a plus 3b plus 10 a minus 2b so walk me through how you would approach this 5a and 10a you add those 15 a good good and then we can combine the B terms yes 3 B and minus 2b right now how many would that be left over just be just be so 1b each other you saw that you can combine the like terms of 5a and 10a and same thing with 3b and negative 2b and so does that look right 15 a plus B yep okay very good so this is some review for you I realize but basically you can distribute you can factor you can combine like terms and that allows you to really simplify expressions great job ',538,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Yes

this tutorial is going to give you an idea of two steps inequalities talk about the type of inequality sign going to look like and also what the get started by using our graph paper in that we trace each term that we have for have to terms on one side and one term traced two boxes on the left and one box on the right and I put our inequality going to allow me to write down my terms solve two step equations our job is to isolate our variable how do we isolate the variable well we have to find an going to make sure that whatever number place it on the opposite side as well because remember inequalities and brother or sister we got to make sure that we have the same thing on both sides and that both are equal and the got to give the same thing to your positive or negative four are additive inverses and it leaves us with just those 5 ends on the left side of our greater than sign and when I put six and now it just comes down to understanding that we have to break our ends apart I have five of them and those 5 ends are still going to be break my 10 into 5 equal sections as well and that would give me the number two for each so where you realize right now that n is going to be greater than two what is our solution set look like for that well our solution set is going to start with n it could be what is a number that is greater than two are we including two in the solution set well it just says that n is greater than two so that means we need to start with the number three and we could have four or five and so on into that infinite direction so how do we graph that up above well on our number line we are going to start at the number two and we are going to use an open circle we do including 22 is not part of our solution is larger than two is part of our answer the second one that came up in conversation again we have two terms on the left hand side we did this time we have a less than or equal to sign so in a minute and then I have one term on boxes first my term boxes and then place x being divided by two I multiply going to put my four and this is where pawn our pawn or our X is getting cut or to happen to them so the way to counteract the division of two is to make sure that we multiply by that same have to multiply every term by that term by 2 and that will save our pawn the single X that it is now what happens to every other term well negative 3 is going to become negative 6 positive for is going to get doubled x 2 which is going to give us positive 8 and now our job once again just like the last one is to isolate our variable what number or card could we put and match up or pair up with negative 6 in order so that this positive 6 those are additive inverses I have to do the same whatever I put on that leaves us with our X being less than or equal to 14 how does our solution set look like well my ex it says right here that X has to be less than or equal to 14 which means we get to start with 14 we are including it as part of our answer but numbers that are less than 14 then would be 13 12 and we would continue in that direction for an infinite amount what does this look like if we graphed it on a number line well if I graphed quickly and draw a quick middle two numbers that are bigger 15 and 16 two numbers less would be 13 and 12 we want to use a filled in circle because fortune is part of our solution set and then showing that numbers are less would be to the left 13 12 and so moment bonus example for you this is one to make sure to cover in this tutorial video for you again I have one term on the right my term boxes and what you need to notice is this right here we have a much especially with inequalities we do not want a negative variable so the care of is making sure that we create a positive variable how do we do that we do it the same way we do any things we I should probably show it next to it become part of my inequality this will zero out and now i am left with a positive 3x and a positive 8 on the left hand side on the right-hand side the isolate our variable just like we did with the other two inequalities what can we pair with positive 8 that will zero negative 8 what we do to one side would do to the other so we are left with 3x is less than when we put our negatives together we get negative 9 so I split up do the same to negative 9i need to split it into three equal sections which means each X is going to be less than negative 3 solution set wise numbers that are going to be less than negative 4 negative 5 and negative 6 to see it a little bit better that numbers that are less than 3 negative 4 negative 5 numbers that are greater than including negative 3 as part of our solution set and our arrow is going to point to the left

working on solving integer equations be talking about inverse operations those are operations that undo each other when solving equations the key word there is opposite the opposite of addition is subtraction like why is the opposite of subtraction is addition they undo each other the opposite of multiplication is division and the opposite of division is multiplication just review the definition of an integer those are whole numbers and their opposites positive 3 negative 3 positive 5 and negative 5 those are examples of gonna solve the equation X plus 13 equals negative 9 now one of the main rules when solving equations is anything that you do on the left side of the equal sign you have to do the exact same thing on the right side of the equal if you have a scale an old-style pen pull something off of this side you need to pull the same amount off of the other side in order to keep it even now as a visual clue for you and for me I like to nice visual aid to help me remember that anything I do on the left side of that line I have to do the exact same thing X plus 13 equals negative nine the operation the opposite of plus or addition well that which is to subtract or minus 13 side of my balance line we have to do the exact same thing on the right side of my balance line on the left side positive 13 minus 13 the 13s cancel and that equal sign negative nine minus 13 with equations here best thing we can do is to go ahead and check our answer and you can check that answer by substituting or plugging in the number that we got to see if it works we are saying that negative 22 plus 13 equals of adding and subtracting integers the going to subtract them the 22 has a larger magnitude than the 13 so we know that the final answer is going to be negative and if I do it vertically 22-13 remember the rules of subtraction 2 is make it 12 minus 3 is 9 this became a 1 well the answer is negative 9 that checks out so we know we got the answer right now what I like to do and this is helpful with your instructor this is helpful for to go ahead and put a nice little box around your answer to help you visually track your final end of the problem because while these are one-step equations can really get up to just about any number of steps it could take off an awful lot of space on your paper eventually so you want to get in the habit of doing something that identifies where your final answer is whether that be boxing it highlighting it circling it whatever works best for you my favorite going to start by introducing my balance remember that if I do it on the left side I have to do the same thing on the right side negative 8 plus y we need to if you remember all the rules about adding and subtracting integers subtraction and negative are two words that can almost be used interchangeably the point is we have a negative 8 here and the operation is addition so to get the opposite and the opposite of a to add 8 or introduce a positive 8 and we have to do it on both sides of the equation if we add positive 8 and negative 8 you get 0 so the only thing left there is Y and y equals 12 plus 8 which is 20 again the best thing to do is to make sure that we got that answer 20 equals 12 well negative 8 plus 20 is this time with some subtraction we have subtracting 32 we need to do the opposite which would be to add 32 and anything I do on the left side I have to do the exact same thing on the right side these two eliminate each other giving you x equals and negative 5 plus saying that 27 minus 32 is negative 5 and you know what it is so again has a final answer subtraction a little bit and take a look at some other operations like multiplication when you see 12 or negative 12y what we really have here is going to be getting rid of to begin step by the way that you do not have to use for a time but if you find that you nothing wrong with stopping but if you complex then maybe you start making some good time to introduce that back in as a as well as an aid to help you see what it is you need to be doing so we have opposite of multiplication division a little little hint or little trick I can use that division symbol the one you in on a little secret fractions are division problems if you see the number 2/3 yes that is two things out of three pieces but another that up to you right now is visually and it just stacks vertically better if we both sides by negative 12 looks a lot like a fraction but we are dividing by because the opposite of multiplying by a negative 12 is 2 divided by that same negative 12 unlike addition and subtraction where we change the sign so the negative twelve are going to eliminate each other and we have y equals and 36 divided by negative 12 is negative three of course the only way to be certain is to check our answer I am pretty confident we got it right but negative 12 times negative 3 equals 36 because I just used a way of writing that you may not have seen a whole lot yet I went ahead and put the negative 3 an operator of any kind right here well the assumed operation is multiplication so what this really is is shorthand rather noise I can put those dots everywhere especially since the dots can eventually start looking like something we want to deal with and of course that X that we use to use to indicate multiplication well that awfully that looks a lot like the letter X which is now a variable that we use so 12 times negative 3 is a positive 36 this does check out so the answer is in fact y equals negative 3 well we did one with multiplication and using division a division that we have to use multiplication to get rid of X divided dividing both sides by negative 9 so multiply both sides by negative 9 you can write it this way you can write it using the parentheses I just showed you about and write it this way comfortable in your mind whatever you like to see on your paper the real point sides by negative nine the nines eliminate each other giving us x equals and negative nine times 12 carry that one nine times one is nine times positive negative 108 I believe negative 108 divided by negative 9 equals a positive 12 well negative divided by negative is positive so that part works out and nine does go into 108 12 times it does check out to finish algebraic equations with integers [Music] ',5,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,Yes

Each\\nobservation measures one or more properties of observable bodies distinguished as independent\\nobjects or individuals. In survey sampling, weights can be applied to the data to adjust\\nfor the sample design, particularly stratified sampling. Results from probability theory\\nand statistical theory are employed to guide practice. In business and medical research,\\nsampling is widely used for gathering information about a population.\\nThe sampling process comprises several stages: Defining the population of concern\\nSpecifying a sampling frame, a set of items or events possible to measure\\nSpecifying a sampling method for selecting items or events from the frame\\nDetermining the sample size Implementing the sampling plan\\nSampling and data collecting Data which can be selected Population definition\\nSuccessful statistical practice is based on focused problem definition. In sampling, this\\nincludes defining the population from which our sample is drawn. A population can be defined\\nas including all people or items with the characteristic one wishes to understand. Because\\nthere is very rarely enough time or money to gather information from everyone or everything\\nin a population, the goal becomes finding a representative sample of that population.\\nSometimes what defines a population is obvious. For example, a manufacturer needs to decide\\nwhether a batch of material from production is of high enough quality to be released to\\nthe customer, or should be sentenced for scrap or rework due to poor quality. In this case,\\nthe batch is the population. Although the population of interest often\\nconsists of physical objects, sometimes we need to sample over time, space, or some combination\\nof these dimensions. For instance, an investigation of supermarket staffing could examine checkout\\nline length at various times, or a study on endangered penguins might aim to understand\\ntheir usage of various hunting grounds over time. For the time dimension, the focus may\\nbe on periods or discrete occasions. studied the behaviour of roulette wheels at\\na casino in Monte Carlo, and used this to from that wheel. Similar considerations arise\\nwhen taking repeated measurements of some physical characteristic such as the electrical\\nconductivity of copper. This situation often arises when we seek knowledge\\nabout the cause system of which the observed population is an outcome. In such cases, sampling\\ntheory may treat the observed population as to predict the effects of the program if it\\nwere made available nationwide. Here the superpopulation is ""everybody in the country, given access\\nto this treatment"" - a group which does not Note also that the population from which the\\nsample is drawn may not be the same as the population about which we actually want information.\\nOften there is large but not complete overlap between these two groups due to frame issues\\netc.. Sometimes they may be entirely separate - for instance, we might study rats in order\\nto get a better understanding of human health, or we might study records from people born\\nin 2008 in order to make predictions about people born in 2009.\\nTime spent in making the sampled population and population of concern precise is often\\nwell spent, because it raises many issues, ambiguities and questions that would otherwise\\nhave been overlooked at this stage. Sampling frame In the most straightforward case, such as\\nthe sentencing of a batch of material from production, it is possible to identify and\\nmeasure every single item in the population and to include any one of them in our sample.\\nHowever, in the more general case this is not possible. There is no way to identify\\nall rats in the set of all rats. Where voting is not compulsory, there is no way to identify\\nwhich people will actually vote at a forthcoming election. These imprecise populations are\\nnot amenable to sampling in any of the ways below and to which we could apply statistical\\ntheory. As a remedy, we seek a sampling frame which\\nhas the property that we can identify every single element and include any in our sample\\n. The most straightforward type of frame is a list of elements of the population with\\nappropriate contact information. For example, in an opinion poll, possible sampling frames\\ninclude an electoral register and a telephone directory.\\nProbability and nonprobability sampling A probability sampling is one in which every\\nunit in the population has a chance of being selected in the sample, and this probability\\ncan be accurately determined. The combination of these traits makes it possible to produce\\nunbiased estimates of population totals, by weighting sampled units according to their\\nprobability of selection. Example: We want to estimate the total income\\nof adults living in a given street. We visit each household in that street, identify all\\nadults living there, and randomly select one adult from each household.. We then interview\\nthe selected person and find their income. People living on their own are certain to\\nbe selected, so we simply add their income to our estimate of the total. But a person\\nliving in a household of two adults has only a one-in-two chance of selection. To reflect\\nthis, when we come to such a household, we In the above example, not everybody has the\\nsame probability of selection; what makes element in the population does have the same\\nprobability of selection, this is known as because all sampled units are given the same\\nweight. Probability sampling includes: Simple Random\\nSampling, Systematic Sampling, Stratified Sampling, Probability Proportional to Size\\nSampling, and Cluster or Multistage Sampling. These various ways of probability sampling\\nhave two things in common: Every element has a known nonzero probability\\nof being sampled and involves random selection at some point.\\nNonprobability sampling is any sampling method where some elements of the population have\\nno chance of selection, or where the probability on assumptions regarding the population of\\ninterest, which forms the criteria for selection. Hence, because the selection of elements is\\nnonrandom, nonprobability sampling does not allow the estimation of sampling errors. These\\nconditions give rise to exclusion bias, placing limits on how much information a sample can\\nprovide about the population. Information about the relationship between sample and\\npopulation is limited, making it difficult to extrapolate from the sample to the population. Example: We visit every household in a given\\nstreet, and interview the first person to answer the door. In any household with more\\nthan one occupant, this is a nonprobability to calculate these probabilities. Nonprobability sampling methods include accidental\\nsampling, quota sampling and purposive sampling. In addition, nonresponse effects may turn\\nany probability design into a nonprobability design if the characteristics of nonresponse\\nare not well understood, since nonresponse Sampling methods\\nWithin any of the types of frame identified above, a variety of sampling methods can be\\nemployed, individually or in combination. Factors commonly influencing the choice between\\nthese designs include: Nature and quality of the frame\\nAvailability of auxiliary information about units on the frame\\nAccuracy requirements, and the need to measure accuracy\\nWhether detailed analysis of the sample is expected\\nCost/operational concerns Simple random sampling In a simple random sample of a given size,\\nall such subsets of the frame are given an equal probability. Furthermore, any given\\npair of elements has the same chance of selection as any other such pair. This minimises bias\\nand simplifies analysis of results. In particular, the variance between individual results within\\nthe sample is a good indicator of variance in the overall population, which makes it\\nrelatively easy to estimate the accuracy of results.\\nHowever, SRS can be vulnerable to sampling the makeup of the population. For instance,\\na simple random sample of ten people from a given country will on average produce five\\nmen and five women, but any given trial is likely to overrepresent one sex and underrepresent\\nthe other., attempt to overcome this problem by ""using information about the population""\\nto choose a more ""representative"" sample. SRS may also be cumbersome and tedious when\\nsampling from an unusually large target population. In some cases, investigators are interested\\nin ""research questions specific"" to subgroups of the population. For example, researchers\\nmight be interested in examining whether cognitive ability as a predictor of job performance\\nis equally applicable across racial groups. SRS cannot accommodate the needs of researchers\\nin this situation because it does not provide subsamples of the population. ""Stratified\\nsampling"" addresses this weakness of SRS. Systematic sampling\\nSystematic sampling relies on arranging the study population according to some ordering\\nscheme and then selecting elements at regular intervals through that ordered list. Systematic\\nsampling involves a random start and then proceeds with the selection of every kth element\\nfrom then onwards. In this case, k=(population size/sample size). It is important that the\\nstarting point is not automatically the first in the list, but is instead randomly chosen\\nfrom within the first to the kth element in the list. A simple example would be to select\\nevery 10th name from the telephone directory. As long as the starting point is randomized,\\nsystematic sampling is a type of probability sampling. It is easy to implement and the\\nstratification induced can make it efficient, if the variable by which the list is ordered\\nis correlated with the variable of interest. For example, suppose we wish to sample people\\nfrom a long street that starts in a poor area and ends in an expensive district. A simple\\nrandom selection of addresses from this street could easily end up with too many from the\\nhigh end and too few from the low end, leading to an unrepresentative sample. Selecting every\\n10th street number along the street ensures that the sample is spread evenly along the\\nlength of the street, representing all of these districts. (Note that if we always start\\nat house #1 and end at #991, the sample is slightly biased towards the low end; by randomly\\nselecting the start between #1 and #10, this bias is eliminated.\\nHowever, systematic sampling is especially vulnerable to periodicities in the list. If\\nperiodicity is present and the period is a multiple or factor of the interval used, the\\nsample is especially likely to be unrepresentative of the overall population, making the scheme\\nless accurate than simple random sampling. For example, consider a street where the odd-numbered\\nhouses are all on the north side of the road, and the even-numbered houses are all on the\\nsouth side. Under the sampling scheme given above, it is impossible to get a representative\\nsample; either the houses sampled will all be from the odd-numbered, expensive side,\\nor they will all be from the even-numbered, cheap side.\\nAnother drawback of systematic sampling is that even in scenarios where it is more accurate\\nthan SRS, its theoretical properties make it difficult to quantify that accuracy.\\nAs described above, systematic sampling is probabilities - e.g. the set {4,14,24,...,994}\\nhas a one-in-ten probability of selection, but the set {4,13,24,34,...} has zero probability\\nof selection. Systematic sampling can also be adapted to\\na non-EPS approach; for an example, see discussion of PPS samples below.\\nStratified sampling Where the population embraces a number of\\ndistinct categories, the frame can be organized by these categories into separate ""strata.""\\nEach stratum is then sampled as an independent sub-population, out of which individual elements\\ncan be randomly selected. There are several potential benefits to stratified sampling.\\nFirst, dividing the population into distinct, independent strata can enable researchers\\nto draw inferences about specific subgroups that may be lost in a more generalized random\\nsample. Second, utilizing a stratified sampling method\\ncan lead to more efficient statistical estimates. Even if a stratified sampling approach does\\nnot lead to increased statistical efficiency, such a tactic will not result in less efficiency\\nthan would simple random sampling, provided Third, it is sometimes the case that data\\nare more readily available for individual, pre-existing strata within a population than\\nfor the overall population; in such cases, using a stratified sampling approach may be\\nmore convenient than aggregating data across groups.\\nFinally, since each stratum is treated as an independent population, different sampling\\napproaches can be applied to different strata, potentially enabling researchers to use the\\napproach best suited for each identified subgroup within the population.\\nThere are, however, some potential drawbacks to using stratified sampling. First, identifying\\nstrata and implementing such an approach can increase the cost and complexity of sample\\nselection, as well as leading to increased complexity of population estimates. Second,\\nwhen examining multiple criteria, stratifying variables may be related to some, but not\\nto others, further complicating the design, and potentially reducing the utility of the\\nstrata. Finally, in some cases, stratified sampling can potentially require a larger\\nsample than would other methods (although in most cases, the required sample size would\\nbe no larger than would be required for simple random sampling.\\nA stratified sampling approach is most effective when three conditions are met\\nVariability within strata are minimized Variability between strata are maximized\\nThe variables upon which the population is stratified are strongly correlated with the\\ndesired dependent variable. Advantages over other sampling methods\\nFocuses on important subpopulations and ignores irrelevant ones.\\nAllows use of different sampling techniques for different subpopulations.\\nImproves the accuracy/efficiency of estimation. Permits greater balancing of statistical power\\nof tests of differences between strata by sampling equal numbers from strata varying\\nwidely in size. Disadvantages\\nRequires selection of relevant stratification variables which can be difficult.\\nIs not useful when there are no homogeneous subgroups.\\nCan be expensive to implement. Poststratification\\nStratification is sometimes introduced after the sampling phase in a process called ""poststratification"".\\nThis approach is typically implemented due to a lack of prior knowledge of an appropriate\\nstratifying variable or when the experimenter lacks the necessary information to create\\na stratifying variable during the sampling phase. Although the method is susceptible\\nto the pitfalls of post hoc approaches, it can provide several benefits in the right\\nsituation. Implementation usually follows a simple random sample. In addition to allowing\\nfor stratification on an ancillary variable, poststratification can be used to implement\\nweighting, which can improve the precision Choice-based sampling is one of the stratified\\nsampling strategies. In choice-based sampling, the data are stratified on the target and\\na sample is taken from each stratum so that the rare target class will be more represented\\nin the sample. The model is then built on this biased sample. The effects of the input\\nvariables on the target are often estimated with more precision with the choice-based\\nsample even when a smaller overall sample size is taken, compared to a random sample.\\nThe results usually must be adjusted to correct for the oversampling.\\nProbability-proportional-to-size sampling In some cases the sample designer has access\\nto an ""auxiliary variable"" or ""size measure"", believed to be correlated to the variable\\nof interest, for each element in the population. These data can be used to improve accuracy\\nin sample design. One option is to use the auxiliary variable as a basis for stratification,\\nas discussed above. Another option is probability proportional\\nto size sampling, in which the selection probability for each element is set to be proportional\\nto its size measure, up to a maximum of 1. In a simple PPS design, these selection probabilities\\ncan then be used as the basis for Poisson sampling. However, this has the drawback of\\nvariable sample size, and different portions of the population may still be over- or under-represented\\ndue to chance variation in selections. Systematic sampling theory can be used to\\ncreate a probability proportionate to size sample. This is done by treating each count\\nwithin the size variable as a single sampling unit. Samples are then identified by selecting\\nat even intervals among these counts within the size variable. This method is sometimes\\ncalled PPS-sequential or monetary unit sampling in the case of audits or forensic sampling. Example: Suppose we have six schools with\\npopulations of 150, 180, 200, 220, 260, and\\xa0490 students respectively, and we want to use\\nstudent population as the basis for a PPS sample of size three. To do this, we could\\nallocate the first school numbers 1\\xa0to\\xa0150, the second school 151 to 330\\xa0(=\\xa0150\\xa0+\\xa0180),\\nthe third school 331 to 530, and so on to the last school. We then generate a random\\nstart between 1 and 500 and count through the school populations by multiples of 500.\\nIf our random start was 137, we would select the schools which have been allocated numbers\\n137, 637, and\\xa01137, i.e. the first, fourth, and sixth schools. The PPS approach can improve accuracy for\\na given sample size by concentrating sample on large elements that have the greatest impact\\non population estimates. PPS sampling is commonly used for surveys of businesses, where element\\nsize varies greatly and auxiliary information is often availablefor instance, a survey\\nattempting to measure the number of guest-nights cases, an older measurement of the variable\\nof interest can be used as an auxiliary variable when attempting to produce more current estimates.\\nCluster sampling Sometimes it is more cost-effective to select\\nrespondents in groups. Sampling is often clustered by geography, or by time periods. For instance,\\nif surveying households within a city, we might choose to select 100 city blocks and\\nthen interview every household within the selected blocks.\\nClustering can reduce travel and administrative costs. In the example above, an interviewer\\ncan make a single trip to visit several households in one block, rather than having to drive\\nto a different block for each household. It also means that one does not need a sampling\\nframe listing all elements in the target population. Instead, clusters can be chosen from a cluster-level\\nframe, with an element-level frame created only for the selected clusters. In the example\\nabove, the sample only requires a block-level city map for initial selections, and then\\na household-level map of the 100 selected blocks, rather than a household-level map\\nof the whole city. Cluster sampling generally increases the variability\\nof sample estimates above that of simple random sampling, depending on how the clusters differ\\nbetween themselves, as compared with the within-cluster variation. For this reason, cluster sampling\\nrequires a larger sample than SRS to achieve the same level of accuracy - but cost savings\\nfrom clustering might still make this a cheaper option.\\nCluster sampling is commonly implemented as multistage sampling. This is a complex form\\nof cluster sampling in which two or more levels of units are embedded one in the other. The\\nfirst stage consists of constructing the clusters that will be used to sample from. In the second\\nstage, a sample of primary units is randomly selected from each cluster. In following stages,\\nin each of those selected clusters, additional samples of units are selected, and so on.\\nAll ultimate units selected at the last step of this procedure are then surveyed. This\\ntechnique, thus, is essentially the process of taking random subsamples of preceding random\\nsamples. Multistage sampling can substantially reduce\\nsampling costs, where the complete population list would need to be constructed. By eliminating\\nthe work involved in describing clusters that are not selected, multistage sampling can\\nreduce the large costs associated with traditional cluster sampling. However, each sample may\\nnot be a full representative of the whole population.\\nQuota sampling In quota sampling, the population is first\\nsegmented into mutually exclusive sub-groups, just as in stratified sampling. Then judgement\\nis used to select the subjects or units from each segment based on a specified proportion.\\nFor example, an interviewer may be told to sample 200 females and 300 males between the\\nage of 45 and 60. It is this second step which makes the technique\\none of non-probability sampling. In quota sampling the selection of the sample is non-random.\\nFor example interviewers might be tempted to interview those who look most helpful.\\nThe problem is that these samples may be biased because not everyone gets a chance of selection.\\nThis random element is its greatest weakness and quota versus probability has been a matter\\nof controversy for several years. Accidental sampling\\nAccidental sampling is a type of nonprobability sampling which involves the sample being drawn\\nfrom that part of the population which is close to hand. That is, a population is selected\\nbecause it is readily available and convenient. It may be through meeting \\nthe person or including a person in the sample when one meets them or chosen by finding them\\nthrough technological means such as the internet or through phone. The researcher using such\\na sample cannot scientifically make generalizations about the total population from this sample\\nbecause it would not be representative enough. For example, if the interviewer were to conduct\\nsuch a survey at a shopping center early in the morning on a given day, the people that\\nhe/she could interview would be limited to those given there at that given time, which\\nwould not represent the views of other members of society in such an area, if the survey\\nwere to be conducted at different times of day and several times per week. This type\\nof sampling is most useful for pilot testing. Several important considerations for researchers\\nusing convenience samples include: Are there controls within the research design\\nor experiment which can serve to lessen the impact of a non-random convenience sample,\\nthereby ensuring the results will be more representative of the population?\\nIs there good reason to believe that a particular convenience sample would or should respond\\nor behave differently than a random sample from the same population?\\nIs the question being asked by the research one that can adequately be answered using\\na convenience sample? In social science research, snowball sampling\\nis a similar technique, where existing study subjects are used to recruit more subjects\\ninto the sample. Some variants of snowball sampling, such as respondent driven sampling,\\nallow calculation of selection probabilities and are probability sampling methods under\\ncertain conditions. Line-intercept sampling\\nLine-intercept sampling is a method of sampling elements in a region whereby an element is\\nsampled if a chosen line segment, called a ""transect"", intersects the element.\\nPanel sampling Panel sampling is the method of first selecting\\na group of participants through a random sampling method and then asking that group for information\\nseveral times over a period of time. Therefore, each participant is interviewed at two or\\nmore time points; each period of data collection is called a ""wave"". The method was developed\\nby sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld in 1938 as a means of studying political campaigns. This\\nlongitudinal sampling-method allows estimates of changes in the population, for example\\nwith regard to chronic illness to job stress to weekly food expenditures. Panel sampling\\ncan also be used to inform researchers about within-person health changes due to age or\\nto help explain changes in continuous dependent variables such as spousal interaction. There\\nhave been several proposed methods of analyzing panel data, including MANOVA, growth curves,\\nand structural equation modeling with lagged effects.\\nReplacement of selected units Sampling schemes may be without replacement\\nor with replacement. For example, if we catch fish, measure them, and immediately return\\nthem to the water before continuing with the sample, this is a WR design, because we might\\nend up catching and measuring the same fish more than once. However, if we do not return\\nthe fish to the water, this becomes a WOR design.\\nSample size Formulas, tables, and power function charts\\nare well known approaches to determine sample size.\\nSteps for using sample size tables Postulate the effect size of interest, ,\\nand . Check sample size tableSelect the table corresponding\\nto the selected  Locate the row corresponding to the desired\\npower Locate the column corresponding to the estimated\\neffect size. The intersection of the column and row is\\nthe minimum sample size required. Sampling and data collection\\nGood data collection involves: Following the defined sampling process\\nKeeping the data in time order Noting comments and other contextual events\\nRecording non-responses Errors in sample surveys\\nSurvey results are typically subject to some error. Total errors can be classified into\\nsampling errors and non-sampling errors. The term ""error"" here includes systematic biases\\nas well as random errors. Sampling errors and biases\\nSampling errors and biases are induced by the sample design. They include:\\nSelection bias: When the true selection probabilities differ from those assumed in calculating the\\nresults. Random sampling error: Random variation in\\nthe results due to the elements in the sample being selected at random.\\nNon-sampling error Non-sampling errors are other errors which\\ncan impact the final survey estimates, caused by problems in data collection, processing,\\nor sample design. They include: Overcoverage: Inclusion of data from outside\\nof the population. Undercoverage: Sampling frame does not include\\nelements in the population. Measurement error: e.g. when respondents misunderstand\\na question, or find it difficult to answer. Processing error: Mistakes in data coding.\\nNon-response: Failure to obtain complete data from all selected individuals.\\nAfter sampling, a review should be held of the exact process followed in sampling, rather\\nthan that intended, in order to study any effects that any divergences might have on\\nsubsequent analysis. A particular problem is that of non-response.\\nTwo major types of nonresponse exist: unit nonresponse and item nonresponse. In survey\\nsampling, many of the individuals identified as part of the sample may be unwilling to\\nparticipate, not have the time to participate, or survey administrators may not have been\\nable to contact them. In this case, there is a risk of differences, between respondents\\nand nonrespondents, leading to biased estimates of population parameters. This is often addressed\\nby improving survey design, offering incentives, and conducting follow-up studies which make\\na repeated attempt to contact the unresponsive and to characterize their similarities and\\ndifferences with the rest of the frame. The effects can also be mitigated by weighting\\nthe data when population benchmarks are available or by imputing data based on answers to other\\nquestions. Nonresponse is particularly a problem in internet\\nsampling. Reasons for this problem include improperly designed surveys, over-surveying,\\nand the fact that potential participants hold Survey weights\\nIn many situations the sample fraction may be varied by stratum and data will have to\\nbe weighted to correctly represent the population. Thus for example, a simple random sample of\\nindividuals in the United Kingdom might include some in remote Scottish islands who would\\nbe inordinately expensive to sample. A cheaper method would be to use a stratified sample\\nwith urban and rural strata. The rural sample could be under-represented in the sample,\\nbut weighted up appropriately in the analysis to compensate.\\nMore generally, data should usually be weighted if the sample design does not give each individual\\nan equal chance of being selected. For instance, when households have equal selection probabilities\\nbut one person is interviewed from within each household, this gives people from large\\nhouseholds a smaller chance of being interviewed. This can be accounted for using survey weights.\\nSimilarly, households with more than one telephone line have a greater chance of being selected\\nin a random digit dialing sample, and weights can adjust for this.\\nWeights can also serve other purposes, such as helping to correct for non-response.\\nMethods of producing random samples Random number table\\nMathematical algorithms for pseudo-random number generators\\nPhysical randomization devices such as coins, playing cards or sophisticated devices such\\nas ERNIE History\\nRandom sampling by using lots is an old idea, mentioned several times in the Bible. In 1786\\nPierre Simon Laplace estimated the population of France by using a sample, along with ratio\\nestimator. He also computed probabilistic estimates of the error. These were not expressed\\nas modern confidence intervals but as the sample size that would be needed to achieve\\na particular upper bound on the sampling error and assumed that his sample was random. Alexander\\nIvanovich Chuprov introduced sample surveys to Imperial Russia in the 1870s.\\nIn the USA the 1936 Literary Digest prediction of a Republican win in the presidential election\\nwent badly awry, due to severe bias [1]. More than two million people responded to the study\\nwith their names obtained through magazine subscription lists and telephone directories.\\nIt was not appreciated that these lists were heavily biased towards Republicans and the\\nresulting sample, though very large, was deeply flawed.\\nSee also HorvitzThompson estimator\\nOfficial statistics Ratio estimator\\nSampling Sampling error\\nNotes The textbook by Groves et alia provides an\\noverview of survey methodology, including recent literature on questionnaire development\\xa0:\\nRobert Groves, et alia.

after looking at units of measurement and then thinking uh limit about similarity that was the young that was in title on this unit if you recall and similar shapes remember their shapes that are exactly the same in terms of their features and proportions what really small things that look the same as really big things and one of the most common places where we find similar things in your life uh scale drawings like maps and that kind of thing wait want to be smaller than the real thing okay so you can actually have a look at the map and not have to carry around you know something the size of Sydney so the idea of scale drawing simply talks about this scale factor I like idea something being compared to something else a big aside and so you just get a fraction divide it by how long it actually is in reality you might find that the drawing is 1,000 for the size of the actual might see that scale written as a fraction you might see it written as a ratio occasionally when you actually have a look at a map sometimes because necessarily make a ratio because we know sometimes see a phrase like this okay so one centimeter to ten meters if you recall ten meters is how many centimeters again each meter is 100 centimeters so therefore ten meters a thousand so this this is another way of saying one to a thousand does that make sense so um the idea of scales really have a look at a couple of examples stay with this color if you guys distance you know it happens to be 1600 meters right and you measure across the pages like on all of the diagonal and this is how far it is how do we work out the scale what come out to this guy right this is just that simple definition for how to get the right length on the top big lake on the bottom right a drawing versus reality so here have 32 centimeters on the top and 1600 meters on the water centimeters of meters I should change them both to the same which would you like me to change them to both to 7 meters I could do either way I could both meters I can change this Isetta meters and a great about centimeters if we change it as you suggested what do I have to do this to no matter how would I write it differently what am I gonna have to multiply by a hundred right centimeters these are lies zeros zeros come a point because that way you can have a small map represents a big thing bottom now so I can get rid of those guys and then I can just crunch this through the calculator I wonder if we can do it you know just look at hot think about it common factors right what can I divide through back I could divide through by 8 can go again with one two three four zeros after it one two three four zero so this is two over 10,000 this four zeros which means done and of course your calculator can confirm that for you so working out of scale is not too hard sometimes you know what the scale is in fact on a map like I mentioned usually right in the bottom right hand corner maybe they tell you that you get your okay I could attract or something like gonna go see your map shows this little little distance and you want to know just the same way I did before with the scale and these two things here with a slight difference when I write this scale equals I have short length on the top long length on the bottom I know it reality is so thankfully I have a whole range of magic mathematics devoted to length okay now I actually know the question so rather than write it as a these guys can talk to each other so left fraction on the right so I can cross multiply and get something just for L L 18 times 250 is can someone write for me thank you I do have a link I am kind of done but the next unit after millimeters centimeters and there are 10 millimeters for every centimeter so I could write this as 450

The following table\\ndescribes the relationship between the number of\\nscoops in an ice cream cone, represented by x. So this is the number of\\nscoops in an ice cream cone. Write the equation that\\ndescribes this relationship. When x is 0, y is 0. When x is 1, y is 1 and 3/4. So let me write this as\\nan improper fraction, just so I can\\nvisualize it better. So this is 4/4 plus 3/4,\\nwhich is equal to 7/4. When x is 2, y is 3 and 1/2. So let me see if\\nI can write this in a little bit\\nof a clearer way. So 2 times 3 is 6,\\nplus 1 is 7, so this is 7/2-- which is the\\nsame thing as 14 over 4. And then here we\\nhave, when x is 3, y is equal to-- so 5 and\\n1/4-- if I would write it as an improper fraction-- 4\\ntimes 5 is 20, plus 1 is 21. So this is equal to 21 over 4. And then finally, if we were to\\nwrite this as something over 4, this is equal to 28 over 4. 7 is the same\\nthing as 28 over 4. So you see that this is a\\nproportional relationship. The ratio between y and x. So let me write this. The ratio between y and\\nx is always equal to 7/4. Notice here, y is 7/4 of x. Or you could say 1 and 3/4 of x. So let me make that clear. So y over x is equal to 7/4. Or, we can say that\\ny is always 7/4 of x. We can multiply both\\nsides by x, if we like. So if we multiply\\nboth sides by x, we get y is equal\\nto 7/4 times x. And you see it here. When x is 4, 7/4 times 4 is 7. When x is 0, y is 0. When x is 3, 7/4\\ntimes 3 is 21 over 4, which is the same\\nthing as 5 and 1/4. So there we go. And let me input\\nit, just to make sure we can input it right. So y is equal to 7/4 x. We would just write y\\nis equal to 7/4 times x. And we got it right.

Welcome to Math Antics. In our last video, we learned about circles and we learned about a special ratio called Pi. In this video, were going to learn how we can use that ratio to calculate the circumference and the area of any circle. The formulas that we use to calculate circumference and area are so important that you should really memorize them. The formula for finding the circumference is: Circumference equals Pi times diameter. And just like most formulas, we use abbreviation: It tells us that if we know the diameter of a circle, \\nall we have to do is The formula for finding the area of a circle is: Area equals Pi times radius squared. Again, we can use abbreviations to make it shorter: Now this is a pretty simple formula too. It tells us that if we know the radius, Well, squaring a number just means multiplying it by itself. For example, 3 squared just means 3 times 3, and 5 squared just means 5 times 5 and r squared just means r times r. So our formula is really just: Oh, and one really important thing to keep in mind is that r squared is NOT the same thing as 2 times r. These two formulas have a lot in common. In each of them, you are multiplying Pi by part of a circle to find either the circumference or the area. In the case of the circumference, you are multiplying Pi times the diameter, and in the case of area, you are multiplying Pi times the radius squared. But do you remember the relationship between the radius and the diameter? Diameter is just 2 times the radius. So we could re-write our formula for circumference like this: Circumference = Pi  2  r. To find the circumference, you take the radius and double it. Then you multiply by Pi to get the final answer. To help you see that difference in action, The only thing we know about this circle is that the radius is 8 meters. First, we use our formula for circumference: C = Pi  d. To get the diameter, we take the radius and we double it. that is, we multiply it by 2. 2  8 = 16, so the diameter is 16 meters. Then, we multiply that by Pi to get the circumference. 16  3.14 = 50.24 So that means that the circumference of this circle is 50.24 meters. That means we multiply it by itself. 8 m  8 m = 64 meters squared. Then we multiply that by Pi. 64  3.14 = 200.96 meters squared. As you can see, \\nthe result we get when we square the radius is very different from the result we get when we we double it. And one of the most important differences is with the units of our answer. Doubling the radius just gives us the diameter, which is a 1-dimensional quantity. So, the answer we get from our formula for circumference is also a 1-dimensional quantity. That makes sense because \\narea is always a 2-dimensional quantity. Remembering that will help you avoid getting these two formulas mixed up. The one that has the radius squared is always for area. But, if we take a slice of the world, right at the equator, that slice is a circle. To do that, we need to know the diameter of the earth. That turns out to be about 12,750 km. Great, then to find the circumference we just need to multiply that diameter times Pi. 12,750  3.14159 = 40,055 km (to the nearest kilometer). No wonder it takes so long to go all the way around the earth! On your mark Get set Go! Whooo - Yes!  3.14 seconds quicker than last time.  Yes! Well, using our formula, we start by squaring the radius. But, the problem didnt give us the radius it gave us the diameter, so we have to calculate the radius from the diameter. The radius is just half of the diameter, so we just need to divide the diameter by 2. 24 inches divided by 2 gives us 12 inches for the radius. And now that we know the radius, we need to square it. 12 in  12 in = 144 inches squared. Next, we just multiply that by Pi. 144  3.14 is 452.16. So, the total area of the pizza is 452.16 square inches. Alright, so know you know how to find the circumference and the area of any circle. All you need to do is remember the formulas: Circumference equals Pi times diameter, and Area equals Pi times radius squared. so be sure to try some of the exercises problems.

So once you decide to do this, you say, well, how do I\\nselect those 30 students and how do I select it so that I feel good that it is actually random? One way to do it is associate every person in your school the first person in the school. then the next slip of\\npaper gets the next person They all should be the same size and then you throw them all, you throw them all into\\na bowl of some kind and this seems like a\\nvery basic way of doing it of getting a simple, of getting a simple random sample. And so all the pieces of paper go in there and then you put a blindfold on someone and so they should pick out the first 30 without replacing them And those 30 names that you pick, that would be your simple random sample and then you could measure their heights to estimate the average\\nheight for the population. This would be a completely\\nlegitimate way of doing it. Other ways that you could do it, if you have a computer or a calculator, you could use a random number generator and the random functions on\\ncomputer programming languages on your calculator, they\\ntend to be something, You might see something like random. You might see, you might see something like random without anything passed into it. It might give you a number\\nbetween zero and one or zero and 100 and you\\nhave to be very careful on how you use this to\\nmake sure that you have an even chance of picking certain numbers but what you would do in this situation if you had access to some\\nrandom number generator and it could even pick out a random number between one and 80 including one and 80 is you would maybe line up and so the first student alphabetically assigned the number 01 and you could just say one with our number of digits. And so the next one, 02 and you go all the way to 79 and all the way to 80 and then you use your\\nrandom number generator to keep generating numbers from one to 80 you pick the first 30 to be\\nyour actual random sample. Another related technique which is a little bit more old school but is definitely the way that\\nit has been done in the past and even done now sometimes is to use a random digit table. You still start with\\nthese number associations with each student in the class and then you use a randomly\\ngenerated list of numbers randomly generated list of numbers and it keeps going well beyond this and you start at the beginning from one to 80 including one and 80. So one technique that you could use is you start right at the\\nbeginning and you could say, alright, this is a randomly\\ngenerated list of numbers. So the first number here is 59. Is 59 between one and 80? Sure is, as long as we, if this was a 01, that would have worked. If this was an 80, that would have worked. This would be our, this right over here, that would be our first name that we, you could imagine the same as picking that first name out of the hat, Now, you would move on. You get the next two digits. The next two digits are 83. then you would look at\\nthe next two digits. So we get a five and a nine. Well, that fits in our range\\nbut we already picked 59. We already picked person 59 then we get a 37. We do that then we get a 00. Once again, not in our range. I think you see where this is going. 91. Not in our range. 23. I think you see where this is going. until we get 30 of these. We just have to keep on going of all of the different ways\\nthat you can get random numbers but it starts to give you some\\ntechniques in your toolkit come up with some numbers in my head? because humans are famously\\nbad at being truly random and you might wanna do something like even use something that you\\nthink is a random process as you thought. So once again, multiple techniques but these are some of the\\nI would say best practices for actually generating\\na simple random sample.

there our seventh graders real quick before we get started on talking about this particular lesson I want to point out a few things when you watch written at the top of the screen looking for the other piece is you will see this number with some letters followed by another number and maybe a letter after that last number but what this is is pointing out that this is a seventh grade target it has to deal with the domain or area of math of ratios and proportions on this one hence the RP and the one is the standard number okay in standard number is specifically what do you need to do in ratio and proportions for 7th grade in the first standard that we are gonna address is this written as a target mind you I can compute unit rates associated with ratios of fractions including ratios of links areas and other quantities measured in like or different units so to start this a ratio so a ratio is a comparison of look at 2 2 5 is a ratio one way to write that is in a fraction form the first number that has said is in the numerator position the second number and denominator position another way to write a ratio is saying 2 with the word spelled out 2 2 2 5 and a third way is using a colon in between them saying that I am comparing 2 to 5 more often than not you are going to see ratio is written this way in this way look at most is in fraction form and with the colon ratios generally have quantity is measured with like or different units so for example thinking of football right now a quarterback can have a ratio of completions to incompletions or completions to total how many completions out of their pass attempts these are two different things pass attempts so for example a quarterback may have thrown the ball 35 times in the last game and had 25 completions so the ratio is 25 completions to 35 pass attempts so we have a label there that gives us what we are talking about the completions to pass attempts we could simplify this I could divide both of these by 5 and say in simplest form that for every 5 completions this particular quarterback had to have 7 pass attempts for that game so every seven times the quarterback threw the ball the ball was way to write ratios the next piece is what exactly is a unit rate and I think example that most of us are probably fairly familiar with and what that is is talking about speed how fast is somebody traveler does somebody go so use that is gonna be 500 miles in 8 hours and this is kind of an average of what when I was traveling to and from Seattle to come back to Missoula when I live in Seattle what I would normally expect to myself 8 hours but what I want to know is really how fast am i traveling for one or in each hour how far am i traveling and that gives me my speed so how do i compute that just like equivalent fractions in like we did up here and simplifying equivalent fractions I want to find what both of these numbers are divisible by so a multiple of each of these however by is actually given to me already I want to know what it takes for one hour a unit a unit equals one of how do I get from eight to one and when we think equivalent fractions I know that I am going to divide this by eight and when we talk about equivalent fractions I want to do to the numerator what I do to the denominator in the gonna talk about ad nauseam so get used to this is when I divide by eight eight eight eight is a form of 1 and when I change the values in numerator denominator gonna change but because you divided by one is that same number so I take 500 I divide it by eight in end up with 62 and five tenths miles so my speed is sixty two and a half miles per hour we will see unit rates generally talked of and said as per whatever the unit is and the denominator so this is a gonna also look at some more complicated unit rate problems so this is just a scenario if a person can walk they can walk 1/2 mile per hour which is a fairly slow pace how long how far will they walk in two hours so 1/2 mile per hour so I have a two hour time frame how do I get from one hour to two hours and this is the going to multiply this by two we would get one mile in two hours okay the complex part comes when we have a fraction or a decimal within that ratio and that is okay we you may have been fraction however we can do that okay one what that time frame is we will say that a person can walk 1/2 mile in a quarter of an hour what does that what is that person speed for one hour what is that the same way ignore the numbers right now what is miles per hour what are we comparing miles to hours or hours to miles we are comparing miles to hours so in that are talking about in this case miles in the numerator position the second thing hours in the denominator position and I am gonna fill in those fractions some of you may be comfortable seeing this some of you might see this is a little bit this because what we want to look at is how do i compute a unit rate unit being want to see whatever that denominator converting to the unit the 1 so this is what we talked about in the previous do I get from one quarter to one we multiplicative multiplicative inverse in a multiplicative inverse is when I take a number and I multiply it by its reciprocal I get a product of 1 so what do I multiply one fourth by to get a product of one I see it as well in order to get one I need to have that denominator how many pieces it takes to make a whole stays the same as for how many pieces do I have that numerator does it take to make one whole and that is where a numerator multiplying by 4 as a whole number or 4 talk about multiplying by 4 what I do in the denominator I need to do in the form of 1 4/4 and fraction operations again I have one half and I multiply it by the whole number 4 we talked about fractions by fractions 4 over to simplify 4 halves for have simplified ends up being 2 so if a person walks 1/2 mile for a quarter hour how far will they walk in 1 hour they will walk four miles try to keep all these videos right around 1011 minutes or less you can refer back to these if you need to in that could be you could be helpful for you I mean this is going to be your warm-up question for tomorrow and that warm-up question is going to be this if Super Bowl party or something making sandwiches 15 pounds of ham and it costs me $45 I want to know what is the cost per pound lb per pound so again cost being the dollar amount being pounds I will set you up at this point right here that for one pound again equivalent ratios equivalent fractions dividing by the same number and the number is given unit rates that number is whatever the value is down here if it is above one divide denominator portion by 15 in the numerator portion by 15 and you

Clark wrote his bike two and a half miles in 1/3 hour how fast did he ride all right so first I got miles and I got hour and I need to know how fast right so how fast means miles you could do mph but I think you understand them mph right miles per hour is miles in one hour go ahead and put in the chart here and I of an hour and I need to find one hour so if I put this over here to plan I want my one hour here no one know how many miles it is okay and then break this up into thirds so here and then one hour is the same as 3/3 okay so a half miles right so this would be two and a half all right and then if I do if I go another one-third right notice this is 1/3 these are the piece same size so if there was one of these things one of these so if I do two of these so 2 and 1/2 times 2 right 2 and 1/2 again is and then 1/2 and 1/2 right so 2 and 1/2 plus 2 and 1/2 is equal to 2 plus 2 is 4 and 1/2 and 1/2 is 2 halves 2 halves is gonna do it one more time so two-and-a-half plus five is gonna be another two and a half miles would be going seven and a half miles per hour traveling at seven and because this is a fraction okay you could also write as a seven and a half miles in one hour excusing or you could say seven and a half miles per hour okay this one I like better though because it shows me that you fully understand and again keeping the ratios okay and again you could have done this by using a complex fraction and said miles right in per hour so in order to take 2 and 1/2 and divide it by one-third okay well if you do that we can say 2 and 1/2 divided by one-third okay well this is going to be and 1/2 two-and-a-half and multiply by three here unless we actually pertain to this we should change this into a improper is four plus one so this is the same as five halves times three over one so half okay same idea I think find the one that you find the most success with all right I would definitely use the number line to start with and then if you can if you are feeling pretty good about using the dividing fractions and go ahead and do mrs.

And what I wanna think about which of these, if any, are\\nproportional relationships. And then I wanna graph them to see if we can see anything visually that makes them obviously proportional. And just as a reminder, a proportional relationship is one where the ratio between the two variables, you could also go the other way around, the ratio between X and Y. But the ratio between\\nY and X is always going to be some number, some constant number. Or you could rewrite it another way, If you were to multiply both sides of this equation times X, you could say in a\\nproportional relationship, Y is always going to be equal\\nto some constant times X. So with that out of the way, So this one over here, let me draw another column here. Another column. This is, let me call\\nthis the Y over X column. for each of these pairs. So for this first pair, when X is one, Y is one half, so this ratio is one half over one. Well one half over one is just the same thing as one half. When X is four, Y is two,\\nthis ratio is gonna be two over four, which is\\nthe same thing as one half. When X is negative two\\nand Y is negative one, this ratio is negative\\none over negative two, which is the same thing as one half. So for at least these three points it looks like the ratio between\\nY and X is always one half. In this case K would be one half, we could write Y over X is\\nalways equal to one half. for this relationship between X and Y, or if you wanted to write it another way, you could write that Y\\nis equal to one half X. Well, when X is one, Y is one half. When X is four, Y is two. When X is negative two, Y is negative one. it would be right about there. And so if we say these three points are sampled on the entire relationship, and the entire relationship\\nis Y is equal to one half X, well the line that represents, or the set of all points\\nthat would represent the possible X-Y pairs,\\nit would be a line. It would be a line that\\ngoes through the origin. Because look, if X is\\nzero, one half times zero is going to be equal to Y. One, it is a line. This is a line here. It is a linear relationship. And it also goes through the origin. And it makes sense that\\nit goes through an origin. Because in a proportional relationship, actually when you look over here, and then that gets a little bit strange, but when you look at this right over here, well if X is zero and you\\nmultiply it by some constant, Y is going to need to be zero as well. So for any proportional relationship, then Y would need to be\\nequal to zero as well. And so if you were to plot its graph, it would be a line that\\ngoes through the origin. It would be a line that\\ngoes through the origin. And so this is a proportional relationship and its graph is represented by a line that goes through the origin. this one in blue. And we could do the same test, by calculating the ratio between Y and X. Y and X. which is just three. Five over two, well five over two is not\\nthe same thing as three. So already we know that\\nthis is not proportional. Not proportional. at this third point right over here, where if we took the\\nratio between Y and X, which would just be one. to see what it looks like. When X is one, Y is three. When X is one, Y is three. When X is two, Y is five. X is two, Y is five. And when X is negative\\none, Y is negative one. When X is negative one, Y is negative one. And I forgot to put the\\nhash mark right there, it was right around there. And so if we said, okay, that maybe these are\\nthree points from a line, because it looks like I can actually connect them with a line. Then the line would look\\nsomething like this. The line would look something like this. So notice, this is linear. This is a line right over here. But it does not go through the origin. linear is good, but it needs to go through the origin as well for it to\\nbe proportional relationship. And you see that right here. This is a linear relationship, or at least these three\\npairs could be sampled from a linear relationship, but the graph does not\\ngo through the origin. And we see here, when\\nwe look at the ratio, that it was indeed not proportional. So this is not proportional. Y over X. So for this first pair, one over one, then we have four over two, well we immediately see that\\nwe are not proportional. And then nine over\\nthree, it would be three. So clearly this is not\\na constant number here. and so this is also not proportional. Not proportional. When X is one, Y is one. When X is two, Y is four. This actually looks like the graph of Y is equal to X squared. When X is three, Y is nine. At least these three points\\nare consistent with it. So one, three, four, five,\\nsix, seven, eight, nine. And so, if this really is, if these points are sampled\\nfrom Y equals X squared, then when X is zero, Y would be zero. So this one actually would\\ngo through the origin, This right over here is the\\ngraph of Y equals X squared. So this one also is not proportional. So once again, these three points could be sampled from Y equals one half X, these three points could be sampled from, it looks like a line when... this looks like it could be Y = 2x + 1. but it does not go through the origin, And these three points look\\nlike they could be sampled from Y equals X squared, which goes through the origin. When X is zero, Y is zero, Any way you look at it, if you look at it visually, it has to be a line that\\ngoes through the origin, or if you look at a table of\\nvalues, look at the ratios, and the ratios always\\nhave to be the same value. And that was only the case\\nwith this magenta one, right over here. '",234921,392,43,0,66,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,Yes

Now, you might immediately recognize that this is a proportional relationship. And remember, in order for it to be a proportional relationship, the ratio between the two variables\\nis always constant. So, for example, if I look\\nat y over x here, we see Eight over two is just four. Eight halves is the same thing as four. Y over x is always equal to four. In fact, I can make another column here. I can make another column\\nhere where I have y over x, And so, you can actually\\nuse this information, the ratio, the ratio between\\ny and x is this constant four, to express the relationship\\nbetween y and x as an equation. In fact, in some ways this\\nis, or in a lot of ways, this is already an\\nequation, but I can make it a little bit clearer, if I\\nmultiply both sides by x. If I multiply both sides by x, if I multiply both sides\\nby x, I am left with, well, X is one, four times that is four. X is two, four times that is eight. We are multiplying by four,\\nwe are multiplying by four. And so, four, in this\\ncase, four, in this case, in this situation, this is our\\nconstant of proportionality. Constant, constant, sometimes people will say proportionality constant. Constant of proportionality, portionality. Now sometimes, it might even be described how is this a, how would\\nfour be a rate of change? And, to make that a little bit clearer, let me actually do another example, Let me do this, I already\\nused yellow, let me use blue. and y is a measure of distance. Or, let me put it this way, x\\nis time in terms of seconds. Let me write it this way. So, x, x is going to\\nbe in seconds and then, y is going to be in meters. So, this is meters, the units, and this right over here is seconds. So, after one second, we have traveled, and you can verify that this\\nis a proportional relationship. The ratio between y and x is always seven. Seven over one, 14 over\\ntwo, 21 over three. So, y over x is going to\\nbe, if we look at this point Seven meters over one second, If you look at it right over\\nhere, if you say y over x, Well, 14 over two is seven,\\n14 over two is seven, and then the units are meters per second. in all of these cases we have\\ny over x is equal to seven, that this is also sometimes\\nconsidered a rate. Now, if I wanted to write it generally, with a proportional relationship, and equation of the form, of the form, either y over x is equal to k, where k is some constant. In this first example, k was equal to four and in this second example,\\nk is equal to seven. Or, you can just manipulate\\nit algebraically, multiply both sides by x and\\nyou would have y is equal to, y is equal to kx, where\\nonce again k is our constant of proportionality or\\nproportionality constant. many, many times in\\nyour mathematical career as a proportional relationship.

Buffington and today we are looking at constant equations you can expect that we will have a mini-lesson some practice and a little bit of application mixed into our the constant equation is usually look looks like this constant K is equal to Y over X but the fact of the matter is constant you would use this equation but we can rearrange the same equation into three different forms one part where independent variable X and then a find the dependent variable of Y and these three equations are used in different ways throughout this lesson I want to show how you would use each of these and to do that first off I think we need to know a little bit about what the dependent versus independent variables are so again the constant here is the proportional relationship between the variables the independent variable is the one that changes and it causes and remind myself to say this say look at how when this changes it forces the other one to change and the dependent variable Y depends on other criteria so when the other criteria changes it is forced to change and when it changes it make that one change and force the other one to change and that will make a little bit more sense when I come to the first sample question I Drive my car 20 miles on a single gallon of gasoline roof I need to identify the constant independent and dependent start off with the constant the constant independent variable is gallons it can change the number of gallons can change as much as it wants and it will force the dependent variable to change the dependent variable is miles the number of miles I can drive depends on how much gas I have but the amount of gas I have does not depend on how many miles I drive see how that works one depends on the other the other can change on the on the first in other words I can make me have to drive more miles but the amount I can drive completely depends on how much gas I have so you can kind of way to think about it is the word per fraction one thing divided by another thing oh look at that car our constant in this example is miles per gallon right and we would write that as a fraction miles divided by gallons so if we think about that and look at our original equation K is equal to Y divided by X we know that our independent variable will be in the denominator and our dependent variable will be in the numerator dependent thinking about it if you write it out in words miles per hour the miles depend on how many gallons of gas you have blown your mind with independent and dependent and wondering what is what go ahead and actually show how you would use these equations my average rate of travel how far can I go in five hours and how long would it take me to drive 243 miles you can see the equations from the first question oh hey there goes another car constant is miles per hour my rate of travel K is equal to Y divided by X miles divided by hours so you can know by this equation that my miles is going to be the Y value my dependent variable and hours are going to be my x value or the independent variable just by the way we divided by three is equal to 27 so I am driving 27 miles per hour that is my put that up there inside the the green box my dependent variable is miles and I use this equation y is equal to my constant value times the number of hours can go in five hours miles per hour we multiply that times gonna go right in there my independent drive four hours it forces the number of variable changes independently and it causes the other one to change that one the answer to that question how long would it take me to drive 243 miles is 243 divided by my constant as you can see in the equation over here in this box your my value or miles divided by your constant is going to give you X which is your hours there we go one here is going to be a little bit different an airline sells four tickets for five hundred sixteen dollars what is the cost per ticket what is the cost for 15 tickets and how many people started number one the constant K is the cost per tickets so that means that I am putting cost up top and the number of tickets underneath that also shows me what is my dependent and independent variables just because of this equation remember dependent variable is on the top of the constant independent variable on the bottom so cost per ticket Wow $129 for each ticket total of 500 $16 divided by four that will give me $129 number to do the other equations I need question what would be the cost for 15 for 15 tickets that is the 15 or the the constant $129 times 15 tickets the cost will always increase when the number of tickets increases you see that it depends on how many people are buying the ticket so 129 times 15 gives me 1935 dollars to take 15 of my or 14 of my closest friends and me somewhere question how many people can I take if I have $750 this is finding out how many people which is X the number of tickets this you will do division using this third equation your cost divided by the constant will tell you how many tickets you can purchase I purposely did this question so that it did not match up it be five point eight one four hmmm so I wanted I did that on purpose to make us how many friends can I actually bring or how many tickets can I buy if I have enough money for five point eight tickets I can only purchase five tickets eight of a ticket or take point eight of your friend on the plane with you right so we need to also be thinking about what exactly the the questions asking our final question is an application and a graph in it and those come from previous lessons where we talked about determining if tables and graphs were represented a constant of proportionality so you do need to know the question the table and graph represent pay for two people working at a book shop do these represent a constant of proportionality what are their hourly wages how much does Cavs earn in four hours how long would it take Maggie to earn $37.50 bookstore so it comes down to pause the video try this one out try and answer all four questions using I color-coded them so you can go ahead and use the equations that you see there on the right try it out and and then come back are you back okay constant of proportionality a constant of proportionality with a graph means a straight line so we know Casas pay is a constant of proportionality the other con table over here you would have to do one our 1250 divided by one which would give you 1250 and then 25 divided by two which also gives you 1250 so you would need to see if they are proportional to each other or if you get the same number when you divide them and in this case yes you do so we are good to go question number two going to use the green equation for that to find the constant the constant is their pay per hour or dollars per hour in the case of casas graph here you see that he works for two hours and gets paid 20 dollars that is a constant of ten dollars per hour we could also look at the graph um in the position of one hour and look that it does make $10 for into these graphs the graph and table math to calculate those so their hourly wages are as you see kaz makes ten dollars an hour Maggie earns $12.50 an hour how much do they earn how much does Kaz earn in four hours this is calculate the dependent his pay his pay depends on how much how many hours he works so that is how you would calculate it using the blue equation the constant of ten dollars per hour times the four hours he works will give that Kaz is earning put that up there and go to the third question how long would it take Maggie to earn thirty seven dollars and fifty cents you set it up in the equation as many hours were trying to calculate the number of hours it is equal to the amount of money divided by the constant which is her constant of $12.50 she would have to earn work three hours to earn thirty seven dollars and fifty cents there we go so that was a lot it was a long video this is our quick recap here we have these three equations one for finding the constant one for finding the independent variable one for finding the dependent variable I hope that

and then we have on sale for $360 the original price minus the sale price divided by your over the original price again so that we already said that $600 gonna do 600 minus 360 so when we do 600 so then when we divide 240 divided by 600 we get zero point four okay and the reason why now because that we want to why we have to multiply by 100 because 0.4 is the decimal value of 40 percent if we multiply it by hundred we get 40 multiplying it by 100 so this TV set was 40% on sale it was decreased 40 percent of the original price okay the sale price is what percent of the original problems are saying alright so the same thing with percent increase okay so percent increase and you know percent obviously with a discount will percent increase what we use that for in real store owners do this they have to buy their products from a basically a supplier or a bigger store or a warehouse okay and they buy those prices and the cost of that is called wholesale so wholesale is what they buy it for but then they mark up the price so they can make a profit so the real retail price is what they sell it for so you I would write this down because retail and those words very much so a retail price is what the store [Music] cells with the store cells or the price have always a price the store sells the item there we go okay and then the wholesale price is the price the store buys the item so the reason why we want to do this is because the store wants to make a profit so they a lot of times increase the price so then they can make at an example all right so the wholesale price of a video game console is $250 the retail price of the game console is 325 what is the percent of the markup on the console okay so the wholesale price so a video game store bought the game console from Nintendo or from Xbox or but then they decided that they need to sell it to you for 325 so the retail price is the cost that they sell it to basically in order to get a profit they need to increase their prices what percent did they mark that up all right so this equation is retail price - a look our retail price of the game is 325 - the wholesale price which is 250 divided by and we divide by the wholesale 250 there we go okay or the original and then we multiply by 100 - 225 is 75 dollars divided by 250 times 100 okay when we do 75 divided by 250 we get it by 100 so we get 30% to count type in 0.3 into your calculator you want to type it or you can just move it over two places to the store marks up their product 30% in order to make a profit okay so another way that you can think about these problems is the change is the numerator the change divided by the original ok so 30% is how much they marked up in this practice with this in class but I hope that you have a good understanding over the process so far if not i really suggest that you watch the video again writing down and think about the process so please at this point in time write two questions to thoughtful right to thoughtful questions about this video think about what we learned and how does it connect to what we have been learning and how is it going to connect in real life okay so with that being said I will see you later in class and about this with you guys thank you so much ',107,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,Yes

NS 1 B this is the seventh grade number system standard one with the sub part of B we are going to continue our talks about integers and we are gonna add integers today using a couple of to be using the number line to show how to put negative and positive integers a new technique that you might not have learned before terms to know please pause the video and write down the definitions to these words right from the standard it says in the wording remember that paragraph was very very standard for you and use some wording or some techniques that might make more sense to you the standard says represent addition and subtraction on a horizontal not going to be dealing with the subtraction per se that has the own set going to be dealing mainly with the addition of these numbers these integers so it says 3 plus 4 you all know what the answer to 3 plus 4 is but to show it gonna go from 0 to 3 because I am little dotted line up above and then go over 4 units maybe draw my little dotted line up connect them and we have just added three and four let me shade that line maybe in a different color I think the book uses two different colors to show to purple line okay so that is three added to four and as you can see we went three units from zero to the right just kind of branched it up to show the four and we land at 7 so 3 plus 4 as you all know now we have a negative integer in play here and it says negative 1 added to 5 so on the number line you go from 0 always start from the origin 0 and go to the beginning part we started units now what direction do we go it says add positive 5 so adding 5 always count it out from this spot 1 2 3 4 5 go blue we went to the left so we ended up maybe we could put an arrow on the end of these 2 so we went from negative 1 to the right 5 units and we ended up at positive force being the answer to this later on the number line 3 added to negative 6 stay consistent here and start at 0 says to go to positive 3 first 1 2 3 little arrow there and we are going to add negative 6 now these back-to-back signs adding a negative really means to the right it says add negative 6 which you would have to slam on the brakes and go the opposite way instead so adding a negative means subtracting count it from here 1 2 3 4 5 6 at negative three we landed at negative three negative three we go from negative four this time so on this one and then they want you to add negative five recall that when going in Reverse adding five would be go to the right so if we add negative five one two three four five and where did we end up we kept going over here and we gonna teach you a different technique that that technique works really well with numbers that will get you in the answer range of like negative 10 to positive 10 sometimes the numbers want to be or the integers are gonna be much larger or very much smaller in terms of to know what the absolute value is because if I teach you the absolute next method so the absolute value has a symbol here and if we just look at this it says what is the absolute value of five well the basic definition if I were to tell you is the number of units away says how many units away is this five we just count them out 1 2 3 4 5 and I usually you know if you were with me in the class here I would I would teach these little bunny hops so the absolute value of 5 would be 1 2 3 4 5 so the distance away from zero on a number line the absolute value of negative 5 the absolute value of negative 5 is the same idea except we are going the opposite same amount of jumps so where is negative 5 it is 1 2 3 4 5 bunny hops away so the answer to this is still 5 the definition it just says the distance between that number and zero so how many bunny hops you are away whether it be the positive 5 was 5 jumps away and the negative 5 was also 5 jumps away and again if you were it you probably would actually bunny hopping around the really a good show where is that gonna that that absolute value when we come into adding these larger numbers so I have a definition sheet or rule sheet here it kind of gets confusing but I am going to take each one of these rules and kind of break it down for you using examples so you might want to write this down so that after I explain these problems you can go back and it might make a little bit more sense okay according to rule it says I know it says to pause the video and practice you can pause the video and practice if you understand the rules but as of right now it says 10 plus 14 well we all know the answer to 10 plus 14 this is 24 now if I were to follow the rules I see that the positive 10 is added to the positive 14 so if I went back to my rules I would use the positive plus positive and kind of follow what this green stuff means is explaining it says take the absolute value of both of your numbers absolute value of 10 and absolute value of 14 and add those numbers 10 and 14 to get 24 the absolute value of them which we know that this is 10 bunnyhops away and this is 14 bunnyhops away and what absolute value is bigger well 14 is greater than 10 so whatever the sign is in the original problem next to the 14 it is number into my answer and that is 24 so we had a little use of the absolute value sign here now the next problem down says negative 7 plus negative 5 so the rules from the previous page and it looks like it is the negative 7 plus negative 5 which is a negative plus a green rule again so read the green rule then follow the absolute value game take the absolute value of each of those an absolute value of negative 7 add it to the absolute value of negative 5 all right what are the absolute values well this one is 7 and this one is 5 the answer or the sign from that into our answer add up our numbers 7 + 5 gives us 12 steal the sign of the largest absolute value and that must be negative so the answer is negative 12 come to you real quick I know it sounds talking a little fast I apologize for number three negative 11 added to six so we have a negative 11 absolute value added to a positive six now this looks a little different because I have a negative our rules and find that so a negative added to a positive we are actually going to then subtract these numbers from each other so 11 + 6 gets me some value of negative 11 well that is 11 bunnyhop so would be from 0 this 6 is 6 gonna take the sign of the higher absolute value which was negative last one 13 added to negative 9 well this is a back a positive add it to a negative subtract those numbers so 13 absolute value of 13 added to the absolute value because the signs are different so if decide what kind of 4 until we take the absolute values this one is 13 bunnyhops 9 bunnyhops away 13 is greater than 9 we steal the sign from 13 which is positive positive 13 so positive for last problem real-world situation again taken right from the standard Charlie owes his friend $10 Oh after one week he pays him six dollars back and after the second week he pays him three dollars back right and solve in an equation to show how much Charlie owes him after the second weekend word problems I like to read them multiple and basically it says we have to write an equation and then solve it so what do we start with Charlie Charlie owes his our equation we have $10 and what do we gonna give him $3 and then we have to figure out after the second week what is he still going to owe his friend we gonna get us up to ten so that will be a solve this 10 is equal to 6 plus 3 which problem but what does what do we does Charlie owe his friend in the coming weeks well if he borrowed or owes him $10 and he only gave them back nine what do we have left well X is gonna have to equal $1 so Charlie owes his friend one dollar we will be doing many many more those bombs this week in small can work on this individually in your journal to find the given terms from page two of the flip chart write a few sentences on what you learn from this video and please describe one real-world situation in which you can interpret sums of rational numbers kind of like what I did there with the Charlie example can you come up with one of those Charlie examples see in

numbers today and rational numbers could be zero any numbers to the right of zero which would be positive and any numbers to the left of zero negative means to the left of zero positive means to the right of zero by definition then zero is neither positive move on and talk a little bit about what certain symbols mean alright this five five really means the line means all right and three really means the line segment from zero to three negative 3 means a line segment from zero to negative three okay all right five is five zero two five but then I what this symbol means the opposite of five and the opposite of 5 is negative five direction not to the right four five but to the left four five after zero and that would give you negative five so the opposite of 5 is negative five the opposite of negative five is five so if you look at this the opposite of the five negative 5 this the opposite of the opposite of numbers just look at the number and anything that comes before the number so of 5 which is negative 5 and the opposite of negative 5 now is 5 so the opposite of the opposite brings you right back to the number that you start all right now that you understand that we can now get into some symbols to help us to add to talk about vectors and a vector is a line segment with a pointing direction so remember I said I asked you what five men and you and I told you that five was a line segment from zero to five well what direction are we going right or so therefore five will be represented like this positive five if you had a vector okay what about negative three a length of three okay the length is positive if a vector is left pointing pointing direction now that we understand that we have to get some rules now for how to add vectors all right if we have a positive number have a positive number and we add that to another positive right pointing positive number okay and if we have a negative number if you think about it intuitively on the number line and gonna end up at some point and then going to the right a little bit more so as you can see your right here you have a starting at zero number all right then from that number the answer is going to be negative going in the same direction same direction these are going in the same direction find the sum and the sum is when you add up the numbers all right they go in the same direction find the sum and the answer takes the sign of the direction well both of these were going to the right right means positive so the answer after you found the sum of both the numbers would have been a positive number these vectors are going to the both of these numbers you would then take the negative of it okay because the sign of the direction of the vector just simply circle the number and anything that comes before it everything that comes before it okay looking at this three this is this this five the opposite of it five and that four the sign of the direction of the vector another one where we have negative three plus a negative five all right circle the number and everything that comes before it circle the number and everything that comes before it okay so I have three remember what this negative sign means it means marriage means the opposite what the negative sign just means the opposite subtraction sign means the opposite at three start at three take the three therefore this is left pointing and this means start at five take the opposite of 5 which is negative five and do I take the opposite of that no start at five opposite of that negative the same direction both pointing in the sum three plus five and the answer is eight and the answer takes the sign of the direction of the vectors if they are the same direction answer will be negative because both factors are left pointing okay answer is negative eight there all right let us now go into the last rule what happens if you actually have vectors that are going in different directions so you have a positive and you have a negative and you can change the order of these you could have a negative and a positive if ok alright well what would the answer different directions if the vectors are are pointing in different directions find the difference and when you find ok so and then the last part of this is that the answer will take the sign of the longer vector longer vector and so okay all right let us give some examples remember if the vectors are going in different directions find the difference and then the answer will take the sign of the longer vector

Barrett we are going to go over less one going to skip over three and get into these two because they are dealing with elbo working on our standards where none go ahead and get started again I have my notes ready to go you should be keeping track of your notes as well somewhere safe that you can go back and see them doing 12 and 14 today and tomorrow combining this one this is the second to go ahead and use this system of talk about adding and subtracting integers today we did a little bit of that last time when we were just talking let go a little bit more difficult today what still should be pretty good first anyone wash it but on Monday nights yes there was football but there was also a great program called American Ninja Warrior I know if anyone knows watches athletes coming at to go through these obstacle courses and for the first time on last Monday night spoilers someone became a full-fledged American Ninja Warrior so my favorite one of my favorite things to watch on that show is very bad at drawing it but you come to a point and there is a wall and on this wall there are some of the rails of wood them with your fingers not sure what like the cliffhanger the ultimate cliffhanger the exciting cliff-hanging or something like that but what you do a strip of wood from the very beginning that goes and not that far so little strip of wood that goes like that and they have to grab hold with their on they have to work their way this way so when you get to the end of this one is actually probably a little further when you get to the end of this one you do nothing else you can do but take another little rail that goes up this way and ends about right there so you have to go this way and then you have to jump and catch on to this one you have to go on that one and you have to shimmy your way up this way then when you get to this the way over here and you have to go and shoot me your way all the way down when you get there you have to drop down then you have to go from here you have to drop down hanging on and shimmy away this way and a jump onto this platform pretty impressive the way they do that so they have to shoot me all the way to come back about three feet in the metric all the way this wind had dropped down and go back this way and then hop ahead and get started with our math figure out what our standard is going to be point n s point a point 1 B so this is seventh grade the number system standard a and 1 b now i do have to apologize on the front row add the number systems actually wanted the advanced one of the advanced domains so we did not take this trying to do the math homework I know a few people found out that they were not able to get to the number system assigned practice so just go ahead and when you get a chance and take this diagnostic so we can get past that and then we can start doing some assigned work on this so this is our standard now thing we want to copy these studies too all right so this standard States understand p plus q remember those are those are going to be variables to understand P plus Q as the number located a distance absolute value of Q hear understand the P plus Q as the number located a distance cue from p so talking about the American Ninja Warrior you have to go this way go back and then past this so a distance cue from P will go into that and get some examples of that and then in the positive or negative direction depending on whether Q is a positive or negative number not on yet show that a number and its opposite this is one of the things we can yesterday show that a number and its opposite have a sum of zero additive inverses as we talked about yesterday interpret sums of rational numbers by describing almost done now real world contexts okay that was a long time so understand p plus q as the number located distance cue from p in the positive or negative direction depending on whether q is a positive or negative number show that a number and its opposite have a sum of zero or our additive inverses interpret sums of rational numbers by describing real world contexts miss that so but this first part means is that we just need to complicated than it actually is it just means that we need to know that when you negative or positive you need to know positive negative positive negative than here okay the second part is that show that a number and its opposite have a sum of zero should be pretty easy for us we did that yesterday and finally interpret sums of rational numbers by going to be using some real world get throughout this lesson are real world questions that you need to solve sort of like this ninja warrior question right if you start at zero and you add one two three four five and then you subtract one two three then you add 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 then you subtract 1 2 3 where do you actually something you can watch on TV already done a lot of stuff that we were ahead and put it in put we really only have one language the discipline that lips not looking so great okay the first one it should be very simple and it is visual so but and you who are spiritual line the number line is a visual representation of the value of numbers everyone should have should see numbers everyone should know what a number line is you start using them very early on in down so that we have that down there the not going to write it down because we did it yesterday is additive inverse additive inverse negative two and two are additive inverse n versus negative four and four are additive inverse right go ahead and get into our details you go going to be doing is to use edition with subtracting today so we are going to first use addition questions like this before we just want to make sure that we understand so that we can use them when it comes to these going to go ahead and draw a number line say this is 0 right there in the middle so we have a negative side and we have a the question just go in a simple question for right now is 4 plus 3 easy right everyone should know that just in their head or seventh grade we should know how to add two numbers so because this is setting up our base knowledge we then from here starting at that point positive direction 1 2 3 so you are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 from 0 and this is going to equal 7 simple should not be a problem oh if a great thing about video is if you need to copy that down you can just positive okay here we go our second part looking at is going to be now throwing do the same kind of question 4 plus negative 3 that is a little different our number line going to start with for lips okay so going to ad- want to add a negative now to adding negative you just you just subtract adding a negative is just like subtracting here you go back 1 2 3 to where your answer is so 4 plus negative going to do for edition is going to be a little bit more complicated negative 2 addition problem but now we have a lot gonna go ahead and draw my number line once again and go ahead and put my zero negative which means we are moving in start from here and go 1 2 3 and our answer is going to be negative 2 and then negative 3 more which would give us need to keep it when we are add but about today we are also learning how to subtract with integers sample problems here the first one is just going to be pretty simple 6-3 6-3 in my zero and then this one is 6-3 so to go negative 3 1 2 3 now our answer is going to be 3 but Ibaka so 6-3 6-3 but everyone knows how to do that in their going to do is to now this is where it gets a little tricky to mike is negative 3 2 minus negative 3 our 0 over here this time out of the way taking away a negative 3 and this is a double negative we have right here so when you do that and can pretend if you like Power Rangers when all them power up they come together this subtraction just think of it like a plus sign so 2 going to actually be adding so 2 plus 1 about this just to know that those two will combine those two will combine so the last one and the last one is if you see something with a word on this one our number line put it in a zero subtract 4 from negative 3 so for this one we have to sort of understand what but we need to subtract that for from start with negative 3 negative 1 day of in the negative direction 1 2 3 4 and now into some modeling before we get working our guided independent practicing before we end our lesson to questions in these are questions you probably will see as you come into the homework and on the test so first number one number one says how would you show negative 8 plus negative 3 on a key number line so first when we see this line is asking on a number line so put in r0 put over here and what we have to see is we have just started with our negative eight start with negative eight one two three four five six seven eight going to go in the negative direction three more one two three and there is would show that problem on a number line number two now you can do this with or without a number line this next one without a number line and just says solve three minus negative 11 if we earlier if you have two negative signs it becomes a positive sign so really simpler which gives us 40 all right our next one number three is going to give us something to fill a into equal negative 1 so negative 5 something equals negative 1 what are we way to answer this you can use addition figure out what we need to do so over little number line so I can visually see negative 2 and a 3 a 4 negative 5 and we want to get to negative 1 that means we need whatever this is we need to move this direction however much that is and we can just a negative 5 negative 5 plus 4 sem negative 5 and 4 gives us negative 1 or we can do even trickier sort of like our question above and say minus negative 4 because those two subtraction signs would become a positive sign all four or the last one is just asking you to see how are these similar on a number line how would these similar on a number be giving you right now are negative 3 plus 10 and and plus negative 3 now you can draw out a number line for that see how it looks what if you could think about it in your cetera so how are they similar on a number line a both end at positive 7 so see questions similar to those as you go through your guidance kind of practice and independent practice will be first practice guided practice is going to be one dash two will work and one dash for homework remember both of these are up on your Pearson and realize calm page clickable online be able to finish those up so those are your guided practice tonight and then for your independent practice I want you to go to front row it now if you did not do the diagnostic for number the number system do that tonight if you have done the diagnostic you can go ahead and go to seven point n s point one E and actually you can also do and 1c very similar basic you some good practice so that is your assignment for this lesson I hope everyone has a wonderful night remember the lesson you are doing tomorrow will not be a workshop so you need going through the actual online resources taking notes the same way and having everything set is the end of our lesson have everyone have everyone ate everyone have a great day and go robot ',27,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,Yes

is 7n s 1c seventh grade number system part one subpart C a lot of words again in the standard I am going to do my best to just kind of clean that up a little bit make sure that you understand terminology it looks like the main word in here today is the additive inverse and basically you need to figure out what the distance is between two integers on a number line and how absolute value may play into that also mainly pause the video a couple of terms blue one is the new one for today and hopefully you have the other ones in your journal already you are going to be showing subtraction on a number line much different today other than the as before for takeaway 3 we all know the answer to that on a number line diagram we start at zero we draw the arrow going gonna just kind of draw this line above for our next part of the problem and it says subtracting 3 subtracting means 3 units to the left and we end up going left at one just as we knew four take away three is equal to one I have I believe a couple other maybe three other situations where the signs are all kind of rearranged in different ways all the ways that you may see them so it might be tedious and boring I apologize for that but I want to show you all the different cases this with a negative one and we are subtracting five from it zero goes to negative one draw your arrow and where are we going we are going to the left five anytime you subtract a number on subtracting a positive number count five units to the left one two three four five and where do you end up negative one take away another five you end up at negative six the third example you might see now the negative is with the number or the integer on the right instead of the integer on the left so positive three take away a negative six how is that going to look so we go from zero to positive three with the arrow and now it subtracting a positive I know I go to the left but subtracting a negative means go to the right so this is where going to subtract problems any longer means adding positive six so what does that mean when we add positive six or use the additive inverse well subtracting a negative really means just plain-old adding and we know that three four five six and you land at positive nine negative four subtracted by negative five I see that back-to-back negative negative to an addition problem subtracting a negative means adding so we take our negative four we go from zero to negative four like we always do straight up here and then adding five while adding five instead of subtracting five right five one two three four five and where do we end up we end up right here all of the rules that we talked about in the last video when we were adding integers because you need to understand that adding is subtracting adding is the opposite of subtracting and vice-versa however before we do that we are going to use the additive inverse and then since we made it an addition problem go back and follow those rules that we use last time right down here on the bottom and I think you already have those written down so you can pause the video if you understand the rules and you understand what the additive inverse is if not follow along with me it says fourteen take away ten 14 subtracted by 10 you know the answer additive inverse rule watch how this works out this problem is going to change from 14 subtracted by 10 to 14 added to the inverse of 10 so if I have 14 added to the inverse of 10 we are now gonna take the absolute value of both recognize that we have opposite signs so some kind of 4 and then who wins the absolute value battle well the absolute value of 14 is 14 the absolute value of negative 10 is 10 and the positive answer which was what the 14 wins out so the answer is positive 4 and you already knew that 14 take away 10 is positive 4 problem 2 we are not allowed to subtract negatives so we are gonna change this into an addition problem and the subtraction sign to an addition and change the second integer to its opposite not all of them go opposite just the second integer in the life negative 7 change it to an addition problem change the negative 5 to its opposites and now follow your adding rules from before I have a negative add it to a positive go back to your charts a negative add it to a positive subtract of - what kind of - all right absolute value time so the answer would have to follow the original problem which had a negative with that 7 because the 7 won out so the negative follows into the answer as a negative 2/3 1 negative 11 take away 6 think of it in terms of money I lost 11 dollars and then I lost 6 more so that add them negative 11 added to this was a are the same go back to your chart and find out what a negative plus negative back to your Charter and listen to me 11 17 do the absolute value game if you want until you get used to what the signs will be any answers without having to do this so 11 6 11 wins out steal the sign following that consistent rule 13 take just gonna add numbers from now on so if we add it we have to change it to 13 add it to the negative 9 this is the additive inverse the negative 9 becomes positive 9 so it reads 13 added to 9 and you all know what 13 plus 9 is if you absolute value rule absolute value of 13 added to that 13 + 9 who wins out the 13 grabbed the sign from the 13 which is positive + 13 + 9 is is 22 positive 22 now a real-world situation here is a word problem pause this on a number line yourself all right here is my number line it looks like I throw a negative in there just in case so negative 10 see if I need more of see if I made one large enough here I might have to get rid of that negative 10 all right so Karen earns $50 babysitting and 30 from doing yard work so again I did make a mistake here it looks like adding 30 onto that so let me make that adjustment here on the left so zero all right $50 range and then put my little arrow sorry the next part is buying no not buying babysitting for $30 what am I thinking here come on read the promised swords she earns $50 babysitting and then 30 $80 and then from there she decided to take some of that money and buy a $25 back 25 so 10 20 and 25 have a different color here back this arrow and it comes right down here in between 50 and 60 which would be $55 so she is up $55 if think it asked for that but she goes plus $55 for all of her work and her purchase in your journal to find the given terms from page two as always write a few sentences on what you be looking at those and then describe one situation in which

Barry and I and move to over the summer we decided we were gonna be moving to Denver we had to decide what do we do to get out to Denver what an idea of what I needed to do was bad United States or it looks a little weird going to pretend so right now or at this were living there and you know next to United States lipstick Sarah mr. president markes okay by the way when we decided to move to Denver we had to decide we have to get from here and our new home was here and we decide how are we going to get there now we of stuff we had to move to everything we had to move so what we had to do was we had to think about all the different pieces that went into this puzzle was it was a problem we had to solve how were we going to solve this problem so the first thing we had to think about was how are we gonna get our stuff out there there were a few options of what we could do we could ship it on a plane they could take it all and ship it we can get a uhaul which is like a truck you can rent now we were going to decide between these two things grow lucky okay we can ship it or we use a u-haul and it was going to be very expensive where either with you all now if we were going other companies and we had to decide value we had to get from here to here as different trucks different sizes now you all you could get one that was 17 feet draw the top of a truck here oh boy okay foot truck for the same price that at Penske we could get a 15 foot truck so it made more sense for us to decide to go with a u-haul so we decided okay no Penske will go with a you all okay now several different ways to pay with you all you can decide to pay my time love my mileage and then you also have to figure out how much gas costs so we had all these three things to figure out and then once we decided that we need to truck out here is it better to do it by take more than a day to get here so the way so what we had to decide at that these other things what are we going to are we trying to try and save some hotels or friends now do we have friends that live in all these places so what we eventually decided was we were going to use a u-haul truck and since the you all is kind of an expensive choice we were going to try and not stay in hotels and stay with friends that meant we found a friend who lived here in Las Vegas which is on the way if I was gonna drive to Denver I will try and go through Las Vegas and this way up over the rocky here while to figure out the rest but this giant u-haul truck is the u-haul truck will it be able to get over the with everything that we own word is different way we found actually we have so instead of going this way we decided and now go this way okay well that changes the distance between here here and our mileage is going to be different our gas cost is going to be different where to go from here to here so we went ahead and we stayed in a hotel right a little bit less stocks were going this way and then we figured we had to drive all the way this way and stop here but we stayed with a friend and then we decided okay so yeah to go by mileage and finally we made try and figure out use every problem you doing things in real life you gotta take me out enough with the moving time all into it and start with our standard and today senator is going to be a long one I believe you wrote it down already but here we go our standard today is seven point n s point 1 C so this is seventh grade the number system standard 1c and what that says is understand p plus q as the number located a distance the absolute value of Q from p in the positive or negative direction depending on whether Q is positive or of our standard open sir understand P plus Q as the number located distance q the absolute value of Q from p in the positive or negative direction depending on whether Q is positive or negative standard says show actually not only use a different color here this is how we can use different colors to our part use a different color show that have a sum of zero and this also means that they are additive inverses and then going to write down names different color again for it and say interpret sums of rational numbers by describing real world contexts okay so that is our important that we have it all down now confusing understand P plus Q as the number located a distance q the absolute value of Q from P in the positive or negative direction depending on whether Q is positive or negative now real quick very wordy linguistic if your linguistic could probably get that a little bit quick little number line okay two plus four so if we go here and this located at distance the absolute value of Q where Q is already positive so is going to be for further than that too confusing 12 written out with words it distance from P okay and the second part should be kind of easy as not as number and its opposite have a sum of zero and our additive inverses okay so if i have two and negative two those will work out to be 0 because when you write it out as two plus negative two inverses okay so those are the two that you to do is take a different color and you can sort of put a box around this going to focus on today the sums of rational numbers by describing real world contexts real world contexts just like up here this problem now this use that real world example to go ahead and direct our problems today so like I said this is a slightly different math just go ahead and put input and first of all i had one just one quick language of the discipline and our quick language of the discipline is going to be range range and range what range is is the difference between the highest recorded value and the lowest recorded value know and you also may have heard that different grades however just make sure you have that down so you know the difference between the highest recorded value when the lowest recorded value is going to be the range now for our to fit it here on the very very bottom today is that we are going to in all of these problems use our logic math is lot of information and we need to figure different things you have to keep your mind wrapped around you need to figure it out just like up here miss Barry and I decided to do this it is a huge task to try and move your a lot of different things you have to think about a lot of different things you have to choose between a lot of different ways to find your answer same ahead and start with modeling okay our input is just that we are going to take modeling so random piece of paper for me going to start off the few easy ones these ones are not going to be difficulties are going to sort of get us right down first modeling question is going to be what is the disc what is the distance between 6.46 sims 4 tenths and negative 8 point 2 negative eight and these two numbers now the way we always like to do this the best way for us to do this for the way I like to do it is much more of a spatial person than logical mathematical okay so so speacial is where I want to kind of keep all of my information I want to view it spatially so the best way to do this is ahead and draw a number line now on this one two three four five 10 negative 1 negative 2 negative 3 negative 4 negative 5 negative 6 negative 7 negative 8 negative 9 and negative 10 okay so that is my number line I can visually look at this problem what is the distance between six point going to be one two three four five six and somewhere in the middle about right 7 8 8.2 just going to be close right distance between these two now if I look between these two things so now I can sort of just count but this visual gives if i look at it okay will 8.2 is about not going to worry about that sometimes numbers can be confusing for me so I go here to my number line and I see that what the distance is so the way you finding the difference so one value minus the other value so a great way to remember it is to find the difference the difference I have six point four which is my first number of 6.4 and i subtract from that the second number negative 8.2 so what going to figure out what that equals now we remember when you have a negative and a negative your negative negative right change it to 6.4 plus 8.2 now we get to four four and two is six six and eight because for me I understand that that works but it makes more sense to me this is about 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 and a little bit extra on either side so I have to be correct visually and logical mathematically it real-world concepts okay right here this is very much math thinking on a number a real world example how about a jet is flying at 32,000 feet a hot air balloon is floating directly below the jet at 13,000 feet how far apart are they now we have a jet so we want to look at this flying right here which again is not noticed jet flying and below that jet the good whatever okay so there we go sitting the jet is at 32,000 feet and the hot air balloon is at 13,000 feet the ground down here at zero now that how far apart are these two things so we just need to find how far apart that is the difference what is the difference this one is how are they related to each other so the difference now on this one to figure out what is the distance and right here so 32,000 minus thirteen minus 11 so the difference or the distance in between these two right here is going to be 19,000 feet so our answer is going to too difficult for just being able to go ahead and do two more of these easier from the the real world context for a three which is the distance between negative 300 80 and 120 on a number line context anymore this is not back to that number line now if you remember from up the difference right so the first number subtracted by or minus the second number the first time it should work the second to subtract this negative 300 80-120 my answer is going to be more negative going more negative so these two a number line this is negative 3 80 and in there going more negative than 380 so we have negative 500 just 380 negative curvature 80-120 is going to be even more negative and get us negative 500 now can the distance between negative 3 80 and 120 on a number line being negative 500 no really quickly sketched out a number not going to be scale- 380 and this is is not going to be negative so really all we have to do is just remember at the end of this we always want these to be the absolute value so our diff our distance between these two numbers on a number line is going to be 500 positive positive we just want this amount of one one last of these sort of easier ones before we get into ones that are going to ask a little bit more France so into those real-world context right now number four says mr. Barry did a cannonball off a diving board that was one and one-half meters above the water he went three fourths of a distance did he cover ok so if mr. Barry did a cannonball off a diving board that was the one and a half meters above the water he went three fourths of a meter below the water surface how much spatial thing here if we have a diving board here and we have a nice little set here and i did a cannonball start there I go down and I went into the water and great so if mr. Bergen a cannonball and it is saying that I am one and a half meters one and a half meters above the water when I start then you this distance is going to be one and a half meters then as I go into the water I travel three quarters of a meter into the water how much distance did he half meters and then three fourths of a meter out of me so this is going to be what is the total distance here so plus the three quarters of a meter that I go under the water and what is that just going to be an addition problem of getting these two numbers together now just go ahead this is easy enough to can become 4 x x 2 same thing to the top so now i have one and two fourths plus three-fourths equals one and five fourths which equals two and one-fourth so once i do my addition of my fractions right there i will say that my total distance covered from my cannonball to understanding that we need to solve a problem real-world problem okay here we to be a little bit more difficult there writing involved here which yourself going to be some right okay all right it was actually pretty correct mr. berry is getting used to Denver okay now in bedroom there are three rows we have Blake market like Margot and larimer first part of our clue there they eat meat sixteenth street that runs east and west ok so again starting to set up a three roads is a piece right here you know the directions these streets are running however is going to give us even more Blake is 3 3.4 miles west of marking larimer is 4.3 miles east of a lot of stuff to put into this a lot of things that are going to change what we do and the final thing you want to say is described larimer with respect to marquee okay now this is a very linguistic question right so what there are three roads that run north and south and these are the three names they each meet another street that runs east to west Blake is this distance from market larimer assistance from Blake and and larimer with respect to market now head at once we have to do work here we have to show our work so again I said like this everyone should be spatial we have to sort of draw an image draw a picture to help us out okay and as we help us start to understand what this is describing larimer with respect to market how far is larimer from marketing of things we need to do before we get to our logic mr. bear is getting used to going to ask us things now there are three rows okay three rows Blake market and larimer that run north and south okay I can do that little truck there are three roads these three roads that lot of space as I do it three roads so let me put a little north the directions are going to be important here so North is this way east south and west so these three streets are going to be running this way north and south okay so i have three streets one right here up a1 here I put one right here now I want to label them I want to go Blake market that are north and south and these are the names off to remember those names later they each meet sixteenth street line see each meet that Street and I know what that streets called this is sixteenth Street okay so they each meet the sixteenth street that runs east and west and got that part ok so to clear it ahead and put an underline under this that part done I said I just need to name my streets and then know how far 3.4 miles west of markets okay Blake one of the streets is west of market okay so right out to myself over your Blake is West this side market so markets going to be if markets this one Blake could be this one if markets this one Blake could be this one or this one okay so Blake is not sure which one yet but Blake will be one of these two streets Blake cannot be this street if Blake is this street it is that direction and again which is you can run logic here if you use our minds and understand these pieces of this little note on the side saying markets here Blake will be on this side larimer is 4.3 miles east of blade ok so now side of market and larimer is going to be the on the other side of Blake hmm a tough situation going on right now so Blake needs to be west of market and look at this Blake needs to be West a liquor mer Blake is going to be west of market and Blake is going to be the west of the other streets then this is going to be Blake okay now i have market and larimer now market is east of Blake and larimer is east of Blake that does not help so I need to decide which one is but look up here Blake is 3.4 miles west of market so that means market is 3.5 3.4 miles east of Blake so this is 3.4 the furthest one is going to be Larry and this middle one will be marketed okay now i have my image the way I want about Blake with respect to mug and Blake is 3.4 miles west of mark get part is going to be 3.4 miles okay east of Blake ok so now larimar Blake last question the question is saying to describe larimer with respect to market the one we are not with the one we do not have yet we know this distance if we know this distance but now that I know two distances I can find that third distance want the 3.4 this is a subtraction 4.3 which is the distance of the whole distance between blanket market which is thing this is going to be 9 this is going to be 0 and I drop my decimal point so the distance between market and quite done because it says describe alam mo with respect to market so now I have to write it out as a sentence larimer is 0.9 miles now am I going east or west lammers east or west lammer is east of market okay and now i have my aunt a lot of work a lot of crossing out things that I already know finding pieces I like questions like this because to me it feels like a puzzle it gives me a few clues and then I need to go through and and do another difficult one not as hardest now this next one is going to be six and number six is just going to be Denver temperatures in December and then the temperatures that are recorded are negative 3 7 9 25 negative 10 8 foot one more negative 3.5 so those already recorded temperatures for Denver the question is going to say what is the range of temperatures okay so we can look at this one now one of these is definitely more difficult this is more difficult a lot more pieces lot more moving parts this one we just need to know what range means we still need to use on brain need to figure out what important parts of information on but we already know what the what range means and range if we go back to our very beginning is the difference the difference between the highest recorded value and the lowest go ahead and take a look my highest recorded value if I look at all these is negative 3 ok low negative 1 no not lower now open of 3.5 and I need to find the difference between these the problems 9.5 minus negative 3.5 and if I going to be 9.5 + 3.5 I write that out on the side here so next easier for me a line up the decimals 01 here 13 drop my decimal in what is the range in temperatures 13 degrees the range will be 13 degrees it varies within negative 3.5 and 9.5 to look at this as well we could go ahead and put a number line have 280 for your six okay on this we get if we want to see the range all these will fall into the range between the highest and the lowest the highest is over here the lowest is negative 3.5 about right here number line okay so once we have that getting all these pieces so Katie sold home a daughter oh I spelled homemade just say she sold art at affair the formula P equals R minus C shows the profit which is the letter P mate how much profit if the Prophet was thirty-eight dollars 41 cents drop katie getting $38 41 cents well done and the rice of the art was pricele art which there is what r stands for was eighty dollars and forty-seven cents how much did the art cost to make see ok so again gives us some different rules different ideas things we need to consider but it gives us a formula so we are gonna just basically fill in for P equals R minus C so it costs Katie a certain amount of money to make the art whatever she sells her art form she already lost this money so whatever she sells the art how much she actually made so her profit we know what he is look up here profit was 38.4 one and we know what our was just go ahead and fill that stuff in so four seven minus c whatever c is and there are several ways to do this different way students logically mathematically wonder what can happen so many different ways logically mathematically we could add C to this site and see to that side and then subtract 38 here and subtract quick first logically mathematically we know we want to keep the equals sign keeping these two sides equal that just is telling us that this side is the same as this act so the first way we can do going to add C to the side so now the new thing is going to be 38.4 1 plus C equals 80 point four seven so i can do that and then i can subtract 38.4 1 and keeping both sides equal announced subtraction problem and then you can go ahead and solve our subtraction problem 7-1 64 minus 40 but our decimal point at dollars and 66 is what the art cost to do it you can always do it that way but time 38 on 4 1 equals 80 point four doing it just use my logic oops yeah it she made $38 she brought $80 whatever cost is going to be think about that logically and say you know what I know that she made that to do all this thing just need to logically know that if she had eighty dollars and forty-seven cents and something was subtracted from it and her final prophet was thirty-eight dollars and 41 cents I just need to fill in this gap here think about it like a puzzle 7 minus what is going to give us one well 7-6 just 14 minus something gives us four 4 minus 0 0 minus something gives would go there yet eight minus something would give us three well that would be go so this would become a four and we have to figure because this would be now make sense but for some of you that might make a little sense and finally since we know that addition is attraction can be the same thing opposite ways you could just do it by saying flip this around and make it a lot easier on yourself this for me confusing what i would do is and this is the way i would do it if i was solving it on my own right now not just teaching it the way i would solve it the way i like to do it if I look at this right here I know that this also means since subtraction and addition can go back and forward I know that if I have 38 41 and the other number is 80 point four seven I know that I just need to add something to get there now this one makes much more sense 1 plus what gives me 7 6 what plus 4 gives the only thing that can happen there is now four plus four be eight and for me different ways that we did that right here whatever works for you works but logic understand what it is asking all go ahead and like our guided practice padded practice and lesson 1 dash 7 guide practice and remember that is assigned on your piercing realize account and then for a dependent practice up with that over here independent practice you are going to front row Ed you are going to do standard 70 s point 1b and 1c and I know assignment for today a member to use your logic all this stuff this is math what you know to solve it in any way that you want I can be figured out in millions of different ways use the way that works for you just make sure you are thinking about you are using your lunch alright have a great day go buffs '",22,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,Yes

Mitchell lost ten pounds over the summer by jogging each week by wintertime he had gained five and won 8 pounds represent this situation with an expression involving sign numbers what is the so if he lost 10 pounds but then he had gained five and an 8-pound how would we represent that well losing 510 pounds would start off as minus 10 and gaining 5 and 1/8 would be plus 5 and 1/8 so about solving this go ahead and try it come up with just got done practicing on so how can we rewrite this well we can write this split this up using the sum of our opposites and this is going to be represented as 5 plus 1/8 so now the up we can deal with the whole numbers so property to put these together and evaluate this so what is minus 10 plus 5 well that would be a minus 5 and then to this so in essence since this is positive and and this is positive this is actually a subtraction problem if you draw it out on a number line we went to the left right 1/8 so if I take 1/8 away how many eighths do I have well that would be 7/8 negative 4 and seven eighths so our final answer would be negative 4 and 7/8 another way to think of this part is remember minus 4 plus a minus 8 8 plus 1/8 and you can do the kind of community property again a minus 8 and a plus 1 is minus 7 8 and then we have 4 plus a minus 4 now we can put these together both going to the left is minus 4 and 7/8 so either way you want to do that some tools to help you make this into an easier problem all right the last page exercise five Jamaa is completing a math problem represents the expression minus five and five eighths plus eight smoke plus eight minus three and 2/7 with a single rational number as shown in the steps below justify each of Jamal steps then show another way to solve the problem so again go ahead and you can just right off to the side what each step is showing and then for your homework or for the rest of this to to solve this in a different way so again stop the video go ahead and write you did so for step one if this was the rewritten as this notice what has happened it has been written as an addition problem so subtraction is the same as adding the inverse 2 plus a minus 3 and 2/7 now what happened from this step to this step we use commutative property because we moved the location commutative property of addition now what happened in this spot well -5 and 5/7 is split up - 3 and 2/7 is split up so this is the sum of the opposites or the opposite of the sum of the sum is the sum of the opposites after that now what has happened well the commutative property you need a property of addition and what this to get one so if you notice this used the associative property to simplify this associative property of addition and then here the difference just added so this is minus five plus a minus one equals a minus six because the next step is minus six plus and minus three is a minus nine because we have minus 6 and minus three is now minus nine and then the last part was minus nine plus eight is minus one okay steps and to finish up this particular assignment you are going to solve this problem again in a different manner so use whatever steps you want obviously negative one but try to see if you can do this in a different way and that will be our warm-up for tomorrow all right see you then ',4213,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,Yes

as it turns out if you combine apples and apples then you as it turns out can figure out how many apples you have but once you start combining apples three apples and four bananas I have be able to see you have seven bananas but you could say you have seven pieces of fruit okay all depends on how you these types of rational numbers with decimals we have to be comparing the same place values and with fractions we need to be comparing the same sized pieces the fractions of something else like on this example place values matters all right so on this one right up and count three point two plus four point zero one equals four point three I really know how they got four point right we see four point zero one plus know seven point three what this means you guys line these up by place value ones tenths and hundredths if you need to put a zero there you then use that one okay and of course we can see that the actual answer should be seven point two one you well you have five thirds minus three of brownies so the five thirds is what we have so we have to look at these two pans of brownies which we I hope you guys like brownies right brownies good that now each pan represents 1/3 of the pan and how many of these thirds do we piece right account does not exist right someone already ate that piece all right well this is saying that we need to subtract three fourths so what what this is not saying is that well two pieces left no that is not what this is saying what this is saying is that someone a 3/4 of a pan which is you know we can do is we need to be comparing the same sized pieces so that we can just eat or see how many of those pieces have been eaten so each of the pans has been them into fourths horizontally like these okay that way we can see how much 1/4 is up and count and now each pen has 12 pieces this pan of course only has 8 of the pieces 8 of the 12 and then up at the four that represents three of the would represent three twelfths and then this this roll right here would represent three pieces out of the 12 eating so someone ate these three pieces someone ate these three pieces and someone ate these three pieces so the question for this is how many pieces is then these eight right count three and eight gives us 11 11 pieces how big are so that would be the answer to this problem three fit five thirds minus three fourths you understand why we need common common denominators but only when is it that we only need common denominators my the only time the only time we need common denominators do we need common denominators when we multiply no we do not we need common denominators when we divide nope we do not gay so you guys said this is confusing what what is the colors are confusing and I like the pictures because I like to draw them yes but again I you can do from now on but I just needed it an example to show you guys what the heck is going on right account because if you guys can understand what is actually this kind of stuff in the future instead of memorizing all the rules like oh we good luck okay so three times two is six and that would be the UM the bottom number so so 6 and then 6 and then you times 2 by tail because you have to do 3 which is 9 would subtract that Oh want some happy yes all right did you just do no could you do it look like to happen if so would you do alright so him yeah so oh how do others make it yes okay so then that would be what do you think well why is it not well will tell us please BAM excellent yeah I example we have the same sized pieces so we can just combine them and right here asked if we should simplify these no you that if you think that simplifying will change this into a mixed number wrong never again no more mixed numbers ever what would it be numbers add these two together man numbers is if we have these directly it is highly likely just to understand the probability is very high that you will make a mistake why because mixed numbers add extra steps which we hate yeah no you are though you even if you simplify you got to change it back into a mixed number you guys to do less work than you want stuff so we got 5 times 12 plus 7 this is changing it into an improper fraction another thing some people forget when we change this keep that negative then plus 13 BAM 34 toys so Wow now what what are some other problems that we run into well some people would say well negative 67 plus 30 fo that give me a 33 over 12 plus 3 BAM 15 then you simplify this you get eleven fifths yes this is all very very very very bad because you know remember how we talked about the order the patient and then forgetting to put stuff back right like you remove the kidney cuz you got to get to the spine maybe and you saying bad order the order is very bad anesthetic going and eating a sandwich and then coming in and then doing the very bad see the order is all out of place okay so doing just what Smith just did I mean I have common denominator of fewer now I got a hundred and thirty-two over twelve and all the camp we got this 67 over twelve so what we got up in counts is the same this is the same size guys are frustrated because someone asked the question so I made up this finish finish all right nice nice Thank You Jacob reven Cinco it would take a lot less time if you guys just 12 negative 67 plus 132 No however you did that is way wrong never a 5 up account and then the 6 yeah is that positive or negative it is positive can this be simplified and new you alright number five ride account so the problem because some of you guys like these mixed numbers things are so one of them one of the main reasons is to say well I got 0 3 and 3/4 minus 1 and 2/3 very very hard to do alright so we do have to change this mixed number into an improper fraction and everyone should know how to do that by now we got denominator thirds we got 3 fourths minus 5/3 alright so how do we do this well we are subtracting so we do need common denominators when we have the same size pieces what denominator should we use well gonna have to multiply it by 3 but if I only multiply the 4 by 3 and just said 3 by 3 also very good what this does is it changes the size of the numbers but not the value of the overall fraction 3 times 3 is 9 now we got to do the other one 3 times 4 so I have to multiply 5 by 4 as well 20 and then of course we have the operation which is minus well now we have the same sized pieces so we are just dealing with 12 we got 12 and we got 9 minus 20 which is negative 11 that is all all right yeah so just to clarify on this we have that as negative 11 over 12 if you want to just make the whole fraction negative kind of weird to talk about negative sized pieces of brownies okay but all of these could be circled as the answer and they would all they all mean the same the three you choose just choose one of them but one of them is negative only one of them not both all right good luck okay I found the common denominator 12 [Music] 15 and then I went 1 I want 4 times 4 over 12 and I said simplified it to 1/6 all right valid question now to get 13 I did 4 times 3 and then added I added the 1 2 oh all right thank you got four times the three then you added this one right account right yeah now up and count and all this stuff it is close well what do we got to do just to what do you got Christian very good yep we got to do four times one up and count forget the signs right that was a negative fifteen twelve yeah and this one was minus a negative so if you want you can make that a big fat plus sign so we can change this one as well two plus well this is good because now we are comparing the same sized pieces as twelfths but now we got negative 15 plus fewer well it was minus a negative four which is why we changed it to plus so continuing this we got twelve still 15 plus four you know Harley right no mixed numbers it appears that it is negative 11th roll you one with models and then after that you guys understand what the heck is going on up in here so that you know why you need common denominators so you know just keep that in mind as we do this so that you guys would probably know maybe a third so in fraction form this looks pretty good I mean we could certainly do that so what do we need on having a pound of my pan of brownies do we talk about the pan of brownies yeah right because we like brownies so much of brownies like at these and then up cut into fourths however over the fourths this piece is missing and this one is missing an ADIZ right so really brownie right home right so this this would represent 1/4 of that pan of why here in a moment so this one is cut horizontally and what are we have in that pan BAM we got a third one piece out of the three pieces and this pan well right your mom comes to you and says hey you gotta combine these two together in the pan and you got to figure out how much there is of the pan you will have to eat your vegetables so or orange which are empty right the only part that exists is the purple so to horizontally like and this other pen I will cut into fourths vertically like at the ease well now we have a different size of pieces instead of the top and being in fourths it is now in twelfths and we can count those out right I mean it got four up and Counting than this four and then of twelve the pen down there blue is also now been cut into twelve parts even twelve pieces that would fit in there I take those pieces and add them twelve - I got one two three four five seven pieces that are how big twelve seven twelfths alright so number eight right now negative zero point five minus because if you change two thirds to a get 0.6 repeating you get a lot of sixes line that negative 0.5 and then this is right so I mean how do you how do you do that well I mean there are ways [Music] really a good way for us to do that so subtracting like this would be extremely painful it is not recommended that you do it this way okay so this one we need to change the zero negative 0.5 to a fractional which is is a common decimal enough that you should know the fraction right away gonna subtract this two thoughts like a we do need common denominators for this one 12 24 18 6 BAM so we are going to have sixths how do we get 6 well we need to multiply this 2 by 3 but the 1 by 3 subtract that up and count this is 3 get 6 2 times 2 then the numerator 4 well once again now that we have common negative 3 minus 4 1 negative 1 7 no come on you guys got to think about it though something guys gonna want to change that into mixed numbers still even after I have stressed as so many numbers on the test you will be marked focusing up count on the numerator negative 3 minus fewer all right on the 3 the - tell us to go to the left how far one two three four four spaces that it takes us to negative seven which is what negative zero point five five is in the tenths position so this really is five tenths and negative five tenths and we can simplify this by dividing both the five and the 10 by 5 which would give us negative 1/2 Christian gone the whole sitting in one of the decks over there does that answer your question were you improper because the the total value of the negative 7 is bigger meaning we could change it to a mixed number but lame yes and I would avoid decimals yes other problem and we operate with mixed extra step in if you get to this answer right like well how many times is the 60 107 watch how much is left over I mean really need to do there you go okay so the first thing you do is you want to turn these two numbers into the same closest thing and this just turn them to a big fat negative so negative over twelve and then this one would be 16 but then this one is nine and that equals negative 25 over 12 so the answer is negative twenty-five over twelve yes all decimals that you should be able to change into fractions and you should know them right away some of these include I mean these ones you could convert 0.5 0.75 0.25 maybe 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.6 and 0.8 these ones you can all to memorize those fractions it just as makes things really easy but mmm for the gonna have to memorize 0.6 repeating okay this one is two-thirds the only you guys to remember because right now into fractions is zero point three repeating which is 1/3 so what what may happen is you may see something like negative 8.6 to change the central fraction which mixed number which is 8 and 2/3 and then you would change this into an improper fraction in order to operate with it but really these all stem from this 0.6 repeating in zero point three repeating be careful make sure that that line is actually there sometimes we assume it is alright here we got seven fourths plus negative zero point six repeating so change that into a fraction all right plus negative point six repeating but two-thirds and then you twelve is the seven times three which is 21 and negative two times 4 which is negative eight and then you add those and then 21 plus negative 8 is positive 13 over 12 supposed to good job you can do it anyways good luck ok so fresh room deal everything so that fat goes down and so it jack duck okay so now we just have this okay try to convert it because to see what is the least common denominator and these is just gonna be 12 so I had a brain even speak right there I was 40 oh but to do because you have to both get them to the least common denominator so you know three six nine twelve and then if Cu the number times the amount of holding up four would be seven times four which is 28 with it four four eight 12 3 times 3 is 9 and then you look like that so 37 can we simplify this am i right [Laughter] got you that way all right thank you very much all right so what the heck happened you guys said that it did it guys said he was wrong is that right also he is right negative or positive if we can change it to mixed numbers all right there was one very tiny thing only one tiny thing that changed the answer very much does anyone see what that is Tigard BAM this negative rad account would have made that negative 28 negative 28 bless old Niner we just need to change the Amblin what is that you guys will think it was gonna be negative 19 negative 28 to the right Niner making the negative 19 12 BAM and yes you have to resist the urge to change that into a mixed number you you know all right barn above that sick right up and count subtract a negative so we can even write six but this one does repeat so you have lots of cities to something young and this one is gonna need some zeros up in yum see that on repeating 0 well where do we start and how do we do this we got into fractions so you change minus 1 into 1 and 6 tenths and still be like this and then 1.6 repeating is 2/3 so team over 30 and 20 you over 30 when you change this into a plus sign and so it will be this ',392,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,Yes

grade seven disconnected we are working on lesson 14 of the module two in grade seven we are working on converting rational numbers to decimals we did in Lesson 13 we works on equivalent fractions to make a decimal this time we are going to use long division to convert fractions into us to using the division button on the calculator explore various quotients of integers 1 through 11 record a fraction representations and their corresponding decimal representations below so I got started this for you I have 1/2 equals that we already know how to change into a decimal right into one of 0.3 3 3 3 3 because I know that this number does not end on the 3 the capacity of feeding infinity of threes inside of it so it just continues how many threes I will put in here but we can do it here as well 1 divided by 4 and that is 25 hundredths 1/5 1/5 1/5 and that is to chance then I have 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 honestly this is not a 7 this is calculator rounds up the oldest sixes because we know that 5 calculator does it it rounds up the last I will have 0 and 16 hundreds and I will repeat that six several times and I know 1 divided by 7 I get this number right point one four two eight five seven one four three okay and then I have one eight one eight is 125 thousandths one ninth we should put commas everywhere sure okay one ninth is one repeated all the time and then we have 111th okay so I have 900 0.9.0 nine zero nine zero nine zero nine okay so what two types of decimals do we see we see decimals dead and these ones and we see decimals that repeat this one this one oh sorry this one this one this one actually does repeat as well because if you look at it it has one four two eight five seven then I have one for three but this is not a three this is rounded to an eight eight gives that one to the two making it three so I actually have one four two eight five seven repeated all the time okay so we have terminating decimals and we have repeating decimals okay so decimal representations of rational numbers we are going to organize the decimals that we have here in two columns we are going to have terminating in the left column and repeating in the right column okay so terminating decimals that I have here are five tenths or one half equals five tenths I have 1/4 equals 25 hundredths I have 1/5 equals two tenths I have 1/8 equals 125 thousandths and I have 110 equals 1/10 okay what do these fractions have in common one thing that we already noticed before the denominator is a factor of 5 or 2 a factor of 5 or 2 these are going to be terminating decimals repeating decimals I have 1/3 which is 3 repeating I have 1/6 that is 6 repeated I will have one 7 that is 1 4 2 8 5 7 and then it continues into 1/4 and I to be repeated I have one ninth that is one tenth repeated and I have one eleven that is nine hundredths repeated what do these factions have in common as I look at it I see that most of these fractions are factors of three or two so I see factor is a 1 and itself this one is a prime 1 1 and so this one is a prime number 1 and itself these ones have a factor of 3 a factor of 3 also is going to give us a repeated decimal okay so in the common part I can write the denominator of the fraction denominator is a factor of 2 or not is has has a factor of 2 and 4/5 okay so here I have to factor of two I have four there is two times two I have five I have eight there is two times two times two I have ten there is two times five in this case they are either prime numbers or there is a factor of three okay so denominator is either prime or we can figure out whether my decimal is going to be repeated or a terminating so we are going to now convert our rational numbers decimals using long division so I have negative three-fourths the fraction bar means division sign right my product is going to be negative will have a negative answer in the decimal point after that I can add as many zeros as I want so I will add a 0 in the next two the three four goes into thirty seven times and I will have 28 subtract and I get two I can add another zero and bring it down 4 goes into 20 five times so I will have 20 and 0 my answer is negative 75 hundredths okay seven-eighths my answer is also going to negative fraction I will have negative quotients again I cannot fit 8 into 7 so I will put a decimal point I can put a 0 on top of 7 not to get confused and I will put a zero next to the seventh a goes into 70 how many times seven eight is 64 right so 864 subtract I will get a bringing it down 8 goes into 60 seven times 56 subtract I will get four I can many zeros I add up after the decimal I can continue adding up those zeros if I need to divide 8 goes into 40 five times ok alright so now I have three 16 16 16 has a factor of it does not have a factor of three has does have a factor 16 now here are the forgot to write the answer down negative 875 thousands this answer is going to be positive because they have a positive fraction 16 does not go into 3 so I will put a decimal point and add a 0 16 goes into 30 only once subtract and I get four and one 14 and now I can bring another zero down 140 divided by 16 is 8 and 8 times 16 is 128 I subtract and I get to 112 I can bring another zero 120 divided by 16 is 7 to continue here and seven times 16 is 112 I subtract and I get eight bring another zero and 80 divided by 16 is five that ten thousandths okay and I have five my answer is going to be positive decimal and a zero five goes into 48 8/10 okay so we are good with terminating decimals they do terminate I have a remainder of zero in repeated decimals you will not have a remainder of zero ever your answer is going to be divided and divided and divided what I go ahead and start with one-third I know my answer is going to be positive divide one by three three does not go into one so I put a decimal place and bring in 0 3 goes into 10 three times I multiply and I get nine subtract I get one I bring another zero and my next number is going to be 3 as well and my next number is also going to 10 9 10 9 10 9 so I want to put a bar over the first number that is going to be repeated over stop so my answer here is going to be 3 for me to put the bar over the first repeated decimal okay first digit that is being repeated negative 4/9 I know my answer is going negative sign right there decimal now angle does not go into 4 but 9 goes into 40 4 times 4 times 9 is 36 I add a 0 and again I got the same 40 right here so I know my 4 is going to be repeated all the time the first 4 not the second one and my answer is going to be negative 4 tenths repeated negative 1/11 my answer is dividing one by eleven 11 does not go into one so up with 0 11 does not go into 10 so I put a 0 over the zero and I add another zero 11 does go into one hundred nine times and I at nineteen nine I subtract and I get the one sorry one I can put a zero and I will be I will have ten so I can put a zero here and then I will get a hundred where I put my bar over the first zero nine these two numbers are being repeated so I can continue with zero nine zero nine zero nine but these are the two numbers that have been repeated both of them have the bar over it so negative nine hundreds repeat it last my fraction is going to be my decimals going to be positive because the fraction is positive six does not go into five put a decimal point add a zero six goes into 15 8 times 8 times 6 is 48 I subtract I get to add a zero notice this is different numbers so I keep 18 I subtract and I get 2 so what number is being repeated 20 right when I divide 20 by 6 I get 3 all the time my 3 is the the one is going to have the bar over 8 does not have the bar over it because it is not being repeated we will have 3 repeated all the time because I will have twelve eighteen twenty eighteen twenty eighteen twenty eighteen all the time okay so my answer is 83 hundredths with the repeated three okay all right so terminating or repeating how do we determine whether the decimal representation of a quotient of two integers with the divisor and not equal to zero will terminate or repeat this is the answer that I already gave you at the beginning so if the denominator is has a factor of three or a prime number it has a factor of two and over five is going to be terminating if the denominator has a factor of two and four five its terminating decimal all the other factors repeating you can tell me well mrs. Lopez what six has a factor of two yes but it also has a have it as a terminating decimal okay all right using rational number conversions in problem solving okay Eric and four of his friends are taking a trip across the New York State Thruway movie they decide to split the cost of tolls equally if the total cost of the tools is eight dollars how much will each person pay so we have Eric and four of his friends are taking a trip across New York so we have Eric and four so we have five right they decide to split the eight between five people and how much will each person pay so I will have eight split into five places right or by five groups divided into five groups so I will see how much they will pay 8 by 5 5 does go into 8 once and then I can put a decimal point subtract 5 I get 3 now I can bring the zero down 5 goes into 30 6 times so my answer is going to be 1 point 6 how can I translate it into one dollars and 60 cents per person one dollar and sixty cents per person friends have a family emergency and the eight holes now so now we know that two friends cannot go we are left with only three people so we have AIDS we are splitting between three people 8/3 I know that 8 3 goes into 8 two times and zero three goes into twenty six times six times three is eighteen I subtract I get to add a zero what number is being repeated six so I will get six repeated even though I got my decimal point how can I translate it into money amount I cannot have repeated six I cannot have I cannot just go to the bank and get six repeated all right so I need to round it to the money I have two and six six six right since six is higher than five that affects my number before that number to the left so that changes into two and sixty-seven cents to $8.67 two dollars and 67 cents per person two dollars and leave it up to you your job is to convert fractions into decimals using long division you can look for patterns will see you in class let me know if you have any questions ',98,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,Yes

episode 14 converting rational numbers to decimals using long division in episode 13 we discussed how to convert rational numbers to decimals trying to get our denominators to be a power of ten or one of our place values such as 10 100 1000 10000 and so on but sometimes you run across these fractions and so if we want to turn a 3 into a 10 we have to multiply by some fractional multiply this we have to have another ratio or this rational number into a decimal using long division so this pretty much literally says 1/3 so if i write 1/3 as a long division problem i set up the problem and I say 1/3 so it kind of goes backwards there and so I do my long division and I know that one cannot go into three so I extend my number but one can go into 10 three times and so I sub multiply 3 times 3 is 9 the difference between 10 and 9 is one I would add a zero bring it down three goes into 10 3 times 3 times 3 is 9 the difference between 10 and 9 is one I would add a zero I would bring it down i would say three goes into 10 3 times because three times three is nine i would subtract i would get a 1 and i might notice that i just keep doing the same thing over and over again so what dividing three into one and then I got a remainder of 1 so I was dividing three into one and then I brought down another place value I ended up with another one so three divided into one and so I might number each time and so what that means is that this remainder is repeating and if the remainder is repeating then my decimal is also repeating and so you might see a lot of times people say 0.333 and then up a dot dot well in math to write it down as 0.3 and then instead of writing it over and over again mathematicians like to simplify indicate that this 3 is repeating by putting a bar over the top of it we call that bar notation so this value right here represents up the three in the tenths place is going to repeat for all further place values then we have this 3 into 8 well eight does not multiply into 10 8 does not multiply into a hundred eight might multiply into a thousand but straight to long division it might be a simpler method so this says 3/8 so when I say 3/8 I go ahead and set up my division problem my 3 and x 8 remember from the left to the right 3/8 read from the right to the left so eight does not go into three so we add a new place value what should our tens place eight goes into 30 well eight does go into 30 and it goes in three times because 3 times 8 is 24 and the difference between those two is six so I was dividing into a six so this is not repeating at least not yet have a 60 so 8 goes into 60 and I know it goes into 67 times because seven times eight is fifty-six i subtract or find the difference there and I have for like for leftovers and so I have divided into three then I tried to divide into is not repeating so i need to add another place value i need to bring it down and eight goes into 45 times because 5 times 8 is 40 and the difference here is 0 and so something special occurs when we run across a zero when we find our difference and what that indicates is that this decimal terminates so we either have a repeating decimal because we added divided into the same number or a terminating decimal because it has ends in that 0 and so our terminating decimal we just pull off the quotient up here is 0.375 or 0 and 375 s once again 27 s is one of those numbers that seven does not turn into a 10-7 does not turn into a 107 might turn into a thousand or ten thousand but I to go straight into my long division so I know that this says 2/7 if i write going to have 2 / 7 once again remember started seven goes into two well unfortunately seven does not go into two so we add a new place value seven goes into 22 times because 2 times seven is fourteen i subtract and get a going to check i divided into two now does not so add a place value seven goes into 60 and it does seven goes into 68 times because 8 times 7 is 56 i subtract that I get a difference of four so I had place value I bring it down seven goes because 5 times 7 is 35 i subtract I get five still not repeating at a place value bring it down to goes in the 57 times because 7 times 7 is 49 I figure out the difference i can remainder of one site of two six four of five now one still not repeating make this longer add a place value hang on to my paper so bring this down seven goes into 10 one time because 1 times 7 is 7 i subtract i should have left more space on my paper i add up though I had a 206 a four a five a one now I have a three and so and I have a 37 goes into 34 times because 4 times 7 is 28 my difference is is right here we divided 7 into two and again and so once we get that going to repeat the whole process and so before we came up with the same one again and so we should notice that digits up top and so everything starting at the first to all the way down to here is repeating and so when we write this out we might write it as 0.28 5714 and it is all repeating because we went all the way back to the beginning to find kind of how we do that long division can basic multiplication and a little bit of subtraction and I know everybody is capable of this i am going to note that this is repeating because we ended up with the same division problem okay so sometimes though we have these fancy little repeating decimals that we need to kind of lead you through some pattern I wanted to change one ninth into a going to go ahead and leave some spaces nine does not go into one but nine does go into ten one time 1 times 9 is 9 we subtract we get one bring down our 09 goes into 10 one time as nine we subtract we get one if we brought down another 0 although you might have stopped this a little earlier because you might have noticed we divided it into one and then again we divide it into one so we only really did one division problem we divided 9 in 219 over and over again which means that we have a repeating decimal so one ninth is equivalent to 0.1 repeating grand we have even if we kept going and we said two nights and we said two in there add some zeros nine goes into 20 times nine goes into 22 times because 2 times 9 is 18 we subtract and we get a 2 so you notice that here we divided nine into nine into two if we do the same thing indicates a repeating decimal and so two-ninths is 0.2 repeating so what do you suppose three nights would be so we there nine goes into three it does not nine goes into 33 times because 3 times 9 is 27 subtract my differences three so once again we divide it into 3 and then we divided into three again so that indicates a repeating decimal so three nines is 0.3 repeating so one ninth was point one repeating to 96.3 feeding 39.3 repeating and so if we tried to do four ninths I suppose we would probably get point for repeating and that is absolutely true and 59 would be 0 point 5 repeating and 69 would be points6 repeating and you get the pattern i think 79 is 0.78 ninth would be zero point eight and nine nights repeating which is actually true and pattern and I want you to extend the pattern to two digits so if we had a repeating digit in the tenths place we put our number over nine so we have this 0.1 repeating is one ninth as we proved right here in this problem and so r 0.72 repeating we have two digits repeating we have two repeating digits goes over 90 91 repeating digit goes over 9 there are more rules regarding repeating decimals that you can look forward to learning in eighth grade

of operations the best way to view order of operations is through the PEMDAS method the PEMDAS method includes parentheses exponents multiplication division addition and subtraction now remember to follow this in the exact same order so we go according to PEMDAS parentheses comes first and then so on now keep this in mind that multiplication and division go together and addition and subtraction go together from left to right for these two groups so for example multiplication comes left to right and in the same way if subtraction comes first we will do subtraction first from left to right over 3 times 9 plus and then brackets well these are kind of parentheses but brackets 3 minus and then again this time we have parentheses but these are just kind of like the round type so we have two different pairs of parentheses so we have minus and in parentheses we have a negative two and then close these parentheses and then we close the brackets and then we have minus eight so we see that we have two pairs of rectangular ones brackets and then these round ones parentheses so according to our PEMDAS method we see that we have to do parentheses first so if we go down here we have two pairs so which one should we do first well if you see in brackets we have three minus and in parentheses or the round parenthesis we have minus two we have to do the minus two first because we have to distribute this minus sign over here or negative sign to the negative two so when I say negative sign by negative two so a negative sign it could also be viewed as kind of put a small one here to help us multiply so we have a negative one times a negative to remember to first bring down everything else just as it is so we have 15 divided by 3 times 9 plus and then in brackets we have 3 now here we have to do the multiplication so negative times a negative gives us a positive so our answer is going to be positive and then 1 times 2 is 2 so as from the negative sign into a positive the brackets and then we have minus 8 so our expressions all right so next thing that we have to do is we have to do this pair of parentheses so we have 3 plus 2 so remember to keep everything else as it is and then just do the arm step that plus and then 3 plus 2 which is 5 minus 8 all right so now we have multiplication addition and subtraction look so according to PEMDAS the next thing that you have to do is multiply or divide from left to right so we see that 15 is being divided by 3 so we have to do division first because it comes first from left to right so 15 divided by 3 we all know is going to be 5 and then bring everything else down so times 9 plus 5 minus 8 so next you have to do multiplication so 5 times 9 is going to give us 45 plus 5 minus 8 next we have addition and subtraction so we see that addition comes first from left to right 45 plus 5 which gives us 50 minus 8 and we all know that 50 minus 8 is 42 and so our answer is 42 now remember that 42 this is the same thing as positive 42 positive sign because remember if a number so this is the final answer to our entire expression all right so this is how you solve an equation with a bit using the PEMDAS method or the order of operations so negative 27 minus 3 and in parentheses we have negative 4 and then close the parentheses and then we have squared and then we have plus 11 or positive 11 all right so this time we have exponents but always remember that according to PEMDAS method parentheses comes first so we see that in parentheses we have negative 4 operation being applied to the negative 4 so we have to go ahead and go to the next step which is the exponent so the exponent is the 2 so that means negative 4 is being squared so negative 4 being squared is the same thing as if you bring everything down so negative 27 minus 3 and the negative 4 being squared is the same thing as negative 4 times negative 4 and then plus 11 so we know that a negative times a negative gives positive and then 4 times 4 is 16 so we get a positive 16 plus 11 okay the next thing that we have to do now is we have to distribute this negative 3 to the positive we know that will always give us a negative so we have negative 27 and then negative 3 times positive 16 is going to give us a negative 48 plus 11 all right the next step is now we have subtraction so we have negative 27 minus multiplication and division and so on so addition or subtraction so we have subtract negative 27 with negative 48 remember if the signs are the same so we have both of them as a negative sign the numbers so 27 plus 48 we get 75 so we have negative 75 and then we have plus 11 all right now we have different the bigger number which is 75 net 75 so our answer is going to be negative and then 75 plus 11 this is the aunt the to subtract so 75 minus 11 is going to give us 64 so our answer is going to be for this video I hope - I hope you guys learned how to solve using the PEMDAS method and once again this is just order of operations except the PEMDAS method is just an easier way of you doing order of operations so thanks for watching and ',17985,81,13,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,Yes

everybody this video is going to summarize the main points coming from open up resources unit 1 lesson 3 entitled making scaled copies now to give you some context as to where this lesson falls in the previous lesson we talked about finding a relationship between corresponding side lengths in figures and we had figured out there was a relationship through multiplication that enabled us to see that every single side length was being multiplied by the exact same number we call that number that every single side length was being multiplied by the scale factor so a factor is a number that is used to either going to make it bigger or make scale factor today in order to actually make the drawings yesterday we were just looking at the relationship in this lesson we are going to be focused on making scaled copies by multiplying side lengths corresponding side lengths by the same factor okay okay so in this task here we are asked to draw a scaled copy of either figure A or B using a scale factor of 3 scale factor of three it means that we are multiplying every single side length by the number three so each of these side lengths are going to be three times what they are now that means this figure this polygon is gonna end up being bigger than what it this time so the first thing we need to do is write the side lengths of each of the figures so in in in Figure a we have side lengths of two units according to these gridlines we can always find the lengths of horizontal and vertical lines diagonal lines so this vertical line has a length of one two three units and this horizontal line has length of one two three units as well now for these try to determine the length of diagonal lines when you get to eighth grade however we do know that this line this diagonal line goes across for one unit gonna take three times that so instead of it going across for one unit this three units instead of going up for three times three units which is nine single length by three so two times three is going to be six let me draw this corresponding horizontal line right six units and not six units according to straight edge but six units according to the gridlines so one two three four five six units across then three times three for this vertical length is going to be nine unit so it that all right down for nine units down one two three four five six seven eight nine three times three times three units which is nine units one two three four five six seven eight nine okay and then remember we said this was going to go across for three times one unit which is three units and it does go going to go up one two three and so three times this is not in so one two three four five six seven eight nine and point starts and where this point ends scaled copy of this figure right here and we can verify that this is six and nine nine units and then whatever this copy of either figure C or D using a scale factor of 1/2 what does that mean length by 1/2 and what does it mean to multiply by 1/2 1/2 means it means that we are going to divide the length by 2 and whenever we get is going to be multiplied by one so essentially we could just divide by 2 but we need to multiply by one just to remember what it means to multiply by a because I dealt with a polygon in a scaled copy of D figure D alright so we are going to the diagonal lines lengths but this is a label the diagonals this is the length diagonals and this is the length of one two three four five six units across alright to draw this the diagonals we to take half of that or divide 6 by two and we get 3 and multiply three times one and we get three so this should be going this look right here this diagonal should be going down for three units should be this goes across for two units and up for two units so half of 2 is 1 so I would this would only go across for one unit and this will go up for one unit so let me draw that here all right just one unit up and one unit across and then half of two we said was one so this is going to go across for one unit one unit according to the gridlines okay then this is going to go down for one unit and across for one unit there we go and then this is gonna go down for one unit and this is gonna go we said if this goes down for three so this goes down for six units in this copy so 6 divided by 2 is 3 and 3 times 1 is 3 this is gonna go across for 3 units and down for three units and across for 3 units as well this will go across for three units one to three units and then we said that this was six times one half is going to be three as well so we will have this corresponding length to go across for three units and this is a scaled copy of this two right here okay all right so we learned that to create scale drawings we need to make sure that we figure out the lengths of the segments and then multiply them by the scale factor and then make sure that we here according to their angles we used a move on to this one our next task asked us to think about whether what operation is actually being dealt with when we talk about scaled copies so it says Diego and Jada want to create a polygon length by a particular number or a particular factor so that the side that corresponds to 15 units in the original so the side that corresponds to this length right here which is this one is five units five units in the scaled copy what what number am i multiplying 15 by to get to to get to five well if I divide 15 by 15 I get one and then 15 divided by one is is 15 divided by 15 is one and if I multiply that by five I will get five so this is in fact the number that I multiply 15 by five fifteen okay so if I were to look at this I could also say that this is this fraction is equal to one-third but I can multiply one to give me five and five can multiply three to give me five 15 and that is using the equivalent fractions theorem all right so it seems side lengths by three and then multiplying by one which is the same as by one-third and if I multiply this side length by one-third this side length should be so 30 times one-third is going to be 30 divided by 3 which is 10 and 1 times 10 which is 10 is this 10 no rules of making a scaled copy but jada jada is because this corresponding part is 10 as well so 36 divided by 3 is 12 here 18 divided by 3 is 6 and times 1 is 6 so this is 6 so it seems like every make sure we already know that this corresponds to that 12 times 1/3 is 12 divided by 3 which is 4 times 1 which is 4 and then 221 times 1/3 would be 21 so it seems like Jade is actually following what we do here so the conclusion here is that we multiply all segments all line segments or lengths by a scale factor so in creating scale drawings we multiply also all all lengths by the same scale factor if you look at this right here it looks like Diego did subtraction he thought that you subtracted the same number from same thing 36 minus 10 is 26 18 minus 10 is 8 and he kept on going exist in the original drawing and like this was just pinched a hole squeezed a whole lot right here okay so this is a scaled copy here all right in the last exercise we were asked to we were told that Andre drawing so that the side that drawing is right here so this side right here that corresponds to 4 units in units what am i doing to for it to get this is how I determine the scale factor 4 times what number equals 8 4 times 2 equals 8 so the scale factor for this for Andres copy is going to be 2 that scaled copy so that Andres figure is to every single length is 2 times the use a the edge of an index card or paper to measure the lengths that we need to draw the copy okay my index card and this right here is this length right here let me just mark it off from here to here right there so therefore I would draw two of these lengths so if I were using an index card with this tool but if I were using an index card I would mark off this length right here on the index card so I draw a little tick mark right here and then I would draw a length I put the index card right here and draw from here to where this tick mark ended and then where that tick mark ended I would move my index card from the big this beginning of the index card to where this mark was and I would continue to draw another segment drawing you just get rid of this line of each of the segments and then just double them okay more multiply them by two so this is three this goes three point five centimeters so doubling that would take me to seven centimeters so centimeters okay and then this segment right here is to be three centimeters three centimeters and then this segment right here three centimeters so right there three centimeters across and then this segment right here is one centimeter so from two to zero and then this sentence segment right here is two centimetres no is it two centimeters yes two centimetres all right so then and then this it could just close out but let me just verify this measure is 2.1 2.1 no 2.6 two point this should be five point two 2.6 okay and then this right here 5.2 all right so let me just close this out technology instead of using an index card but this is how it would actually work so this is how you would make a scaled copy of this and to summarize creating a scaled copy involves multiplying the lengths so we are multiplying the lengths in the original figure by a scale factor scale factor is the number that you are multiplying every single side length by two to scale it to make it either bigger or smaller or if the scale factor is one to keep every single length the same one thing that you should observe is that if that is greater than one then the figure less than one the figure should get smaller for example to make a scaled copy of triangle ABC as you can see here where the base is eight units we would use a scale factor of four so scale factor is the number that multiplies each corresponding length so this length matches this length right here because corresponding parts are located in the same location or the same position in copies so multiply this by 4 I would essentially do the exact same thing to this length right there and 2 and 24 hundredths or 2.2 4 is multiplied by 4 to give us 8 + 96 hundredths or 896 hundredths as well so I hope that you got the main points out of this is in that multiplying side lengths is what we copies of figures from original figures and we use a scale factor and that scale factor is the number that multiplies every single side length to give us the new measurements and that number has to be the exact same number hope that you enjoyed this video and come back for some more videos throughout your open up math experience take care everybody

two-dimensional shapes a couple lessons ago we we talked about how to find the circumference an area of circles and then yesterday our focus was on irregular or composite shapes and finding the area or distance around those shapes today is our transition into three-dimensional figures where we will spend about three or four days finding surface area and volume and things like that with three-dimensional figures so our main focus today is on slicing three-dimensional figures and the two-dimensional figure that shows up order to do that we have to spend a few minutes reviewing some stuff from earlier grades like names of specific parts of two-dimensional shapes and three-dimensional shapes before we do that we need to watch this little video here and this is kind of a summary of put some terminologies to some things from the past and before we do that the reason why we are slicing figures it as it is is it clearly states right here this is one of our 7th grade standard slicing three-dimensional figures in plane sections ok so background knowledge from earlier grades a plane is a flat surface and when we are slicing these three-dimensional shapes we are looking at the actual plane that results from that and a plane as it says up here is a flat surface that extends forever in all directions typically planes are made up of three lines three points that are not on the same line and we also need to talk a little bit about shapes and their names we all know that a three sided shape is called a triangle and there are various types of triangles but triangle right now 4-sided shapes the main category of them is quadrilaterals but there are specific ones like trapezoids like rectangles like a parallelogram as a rectangle that got squished sideways because the same attributes are true about both accept what the angles that were 90 degree angles are no longer 90-degree angles and the same thing is true with regards to a square if you sit on the corner of a square and squish in sideways that does not change the side lengths and we typically call that shape a rhombus so with the parallelogram when compared to a rectangle as opposed to a square and 5 sided shapes are all in the category all called hexagons now we could go above that for example a seven sided shape is called a heptagon eight is an octagon nine is a nonagon 10 is a decagon anybody know the name of a 12-sided shape to dodecagon but though we can continue on but these are the main ones and these are the main ones that we want to focus on today when we do our little activity on the iPads of shapes and in addition to that we were also concerned about a couple of or a squished circle which some of you really called any ellipse so those are all the main shapes that we are concerned with today the other thing throwing around names of talking about a vertex or plural for that as vertices these are the corners of any three-dimensional shape and then the edges are the line segments that make up that shape and then the faces are the actual sides that make it up so made up of also four triangles there and it is that bottom or the base that is very important and that leads us to how name different three-dimensional shapes so since the square is the base we call that a square pyramid and here is where in your notes once again the square is the base and the base defines the name of that figure so since the base is a square and this is a pyramid this is called a square pyramid and when we go to find volume of three-dimensional help you the most thinking of the name going to go about trying to find the volume of the shape because because not as everything is nice and easy like a rectangular prism which is what you would have done in the sixth grade so here are some more shapes and their names this is a square prism because it has a base that is a square and it is a prism however this is a triangular prism because the base is a triangle and it is a prism this is a square pyramid because the base is a square and it is a pyramid this however is not a square pyramid base is a triangle then we have cylinders where the base is a circle cylinder we also have cones whose base is a circle sometimes a cone is also referred to as a right circular cone and all of this I know is in your notes so to fill something out a cross section is the two-dimensional shape that is exposed by making a straight cut through something might be a horizontal cut might be a vertical cut might be a diagonal cut then in that video all of those things were talked about and today activity here in a couple minutes I horizontal cut straight across our vertical cuts straight up and down I want you to try and go diagonally too figure out all the different shapes that of a vertical cross-section cut through right there that is the cross section okay so if I give you a cylinder and I cut it right there anybody know the name section there this is going to be one of kind of hard to visualize what that is rectangle and sometimes you need to kind of think of what it would look like straight on and that was one of the things mentioned in that video straight on it looks like that and that is a that direction horizontally instead of look like which is totally different right would that be any lips know what would it be yeah and you have to think about it straight on I mean if this is a glass of some sort of liquid like this and you look at it from the top there are met very many glasses that you drink out of that are in the shape of an clearly a circle so sometimes we have to think about looking at that cross-section straight on okay all right in your notes one through four go ahead and write the name of the shape of the with our shoulder partner so this is one of those things where some people can just look and they know what the cross visualize and once again the hard to of us using the ipad today through it a little activity where you can sort of manipulate things to help you see the cross section a little better but number one should clearly be a rectangle number two if you look at it straight on it should be a triangle the cross section number three should be a rectangle some of you might have thought I was a square slightly so that makes it a rectangle going to see today as you start to shift the cross section around vertically horizontally diagonally the shape will change with just a little movement and number four is by far the toughest one to see but that is a triangle so let me start with in your notes it is a cone website which it should have it in your notes and all of your screens will start like this okay and right here this supposed to start with the shape of a cone and by default it shows up like sliders around and the shapes that ellipse so you would write down the word ellipse as I move this thing around I can easily make a circle as well but you want to move all the sliders around just to kind of see what that cross section will look like you can even change the radius of the original shape so there are lots of things that you can do and all the shapes that you see with your shoulder partner now the ones will take the iPad first the twos will be writing going to flip okay but just make sure that both of you have all the names of the shapes written down so the ones will take number one shape the twos will take number two shape as far as the iPad and forth now what does the second one say to do you start with a column then default notice that the base is not a the slider you can change the the base to a different number of lateral faces so right here we have a triangular pyramid if you were asked to do something like that then you could change it okay so what I want to do is some of the probably the most common cross-sections these are just the majority of the cross section so with the cone you should have certainly seen a circle and an ellipse and most of you also saw that if you went vertically you could also get a triangle in there and could find in there as well then the next shape you were supposed to do is a triangular pyramid so some of the most common ones obviously triangle both directions you should have also seen that you can make a trapezoid in there or other versions of a quadrilateral then you shifted to square pyramids and then this is where you could start to get more shapes you should have seen a square or rectangle of both a triangle and then also a trapezoid and probably a few other things in there that you could have found but it was the last one where lots of things could happen and you should have definitely seen a triangle square rectangle trapezoid then we could start getting to shapes with more sides like a pentagon or even like a hexagon some people in third period claim and thinking they got a seven and eight there so it was much easier for you to see these cross sections with this did it but this idea of a section it basically is a prelude to several topics discussed in calculus and are in honors classes at the junior high or middle school Everest a level is to school but one topic is finding the volume of an object by slicing and when we talk about the volume of a pyramid the cross section and utilizing calculus will prove the formula for the volume of principle and that principle states that the volumes of two objects are equal if the areas of their corresponding cross sections are in all cases equal so have a pile of quarters it should be obvious to you that if i squish the pile of quarters sideways that it should still have the same volume the reason that they have the same volume is because the stack of quarters has the same height and each quarter is actual the actually the cross-section and obviously all those quarters have the same area so let me bring up a little demo here to further show that idea and so um it for some reason it takes this oh there we go okay so we have three different shapes here we have a triangular pyramid we have a square pyramid and then we have some funky pyramid there the base of it is some weird shape and you can see it in green there but calvi aires principles tells us that they have to have the same volume and the reason is because they same height and in addition to that the area of their cross sections is equal to each other so the area of this cross section that triangle is 6.8 and geo geogebra is doing all the math for us and the area of that quadrilateral there has an area of 6.8 and then the air of that green section at 6.8 so Baikal varies principle they have to have the same volume even though there are three totally different shapes are the same height and their cross sections have the same area okay all right and that is it for today

The ratio was two to one. - [Brett] So at the beginning, you were actually very close. - [Sal] I was spot on at the beginning. - You were spot on. Which is why I disagree with that. I think that the more trials,\\nit just happened that it, it kind of took me off\\nthe right path, this time. But I think if I did\\nthat more times than not, it would get me closer\\nto the right answer. - [Brett] I have a little simulation here that saves us time, it does\\nthe random picking for us. And it allows me to start with\\nfour whites and two blacks. do many selections for us. - [Sal] So this is, every selection, randomly picking out a marble. And you see that the percentage of white, Or four to two ratio, I\\nshould say, of white to black. - [Brett] So I think I believe you now. Because at the beginning\\nI see a lot of variation on this graph over time. one in a quadrillion circumstances where it just kept picking\\na white every time, but you know this is\\nconsistent with the intuition, as the more trials you have,\\nit just becomes harder, the probability of it being\\na significant departure from the actual proportion becomes lower.

this is 7sp five seventh-grade sedan statistics and probability standard 5 video 1 understanding probability in this standard we are going to be working with probability of events and and knowing that all probabilities are fractions between 0 and 1 and the closer to 0 or the closer to 1 an event is that will indicate its probability or the likelihood of that like you to copy these down in your journal and define them alright here are defined you could pause the video and write that in and here is the equation that we use to find the probability of something occurring and we call it the to be using that in the next few gonna need you to be very familiar with memorizing but if there was something to fraction decimal percentage and wording all of those options for probability alright our first example it says find the probability of randomly choosing a blue marble from the marbles that are here we have a couple different colors of marbles and setting up the actual question it says find the probability going to randomly choose a blue marble from the total amount of marbles and if we had this in fraction form what is the total amount of outcomes that could occur so all of the outcomes are all of the different marbles regardless of their color we count them up one two three four five six seven eight nine we have ten total marbles so that goes in your denominator and then the numerator is the number of favorable outcomes for the events so basically what do we want to have happen what are we looking for it to occur well there are three of them now using that fraction we are going to then determine on the probability chart what the likelihood of this event for to chart we said that the probability of 3 out of 10 which is 3/10 will fall somewhere on this table is it closer to impossible which is a 0% chance or is it closer to certain which is a hundred percent chance the problem that we have right now is that all of our fractions are not in tenths so what we can do is we can create new fractions replacing the fractions that are currently on our table by using the denominator of 10 and I think the easiest place to start with that would be right in the middle and we are going to alter this 1/2 using a all going to be using a denominator of 10 now equivalent fractions here in the equivalent fraction to 1/2 well if I have 10 items in the denominator 1/2 would be 5 of them and if you think about that fraction being reduced 5 over 10 reduces to 1/2 now because we have the equivalent fraction and I think maybe going over on the edges would be the next easiest thing for us to do so if I have a 0 and my denominator is 10 my numerator would have to be 0 because 0 divided by anything is equal to 0 so we have zero tenths representing zero we have five all the way down to the other edge and we see that we have one whole well if what would go in the numerator to make going to eat all 10 of them so 10 out of 10 now represents the 1 all right what are we going to do about these fourths the fractions call the fourth and three-fourths all right representation for 1/4 in the denominator of tenths then I can take the halfway point or the mean average of 0 and 5 well the halfway point between if you two and that would be 2 and 1/2 so we have 2 and 1/2 tenths what are we going halfway point on a number line if I have a 5 on one end so I think now we have a better idea of think about it well if this is zero and this is five and we have two and a half one five this is three this is two so say so we can kind of like draw the little arrow so 3/10 is going to be the likelihood of this event occurring if I were to put my hand into a bag of marbles and pull out one of these 3 blue marbles what is the likelihood I think equally likely to occur probably closer to unlikely all right now what is that as a decimal well you take the top and divide it by the bottom so the numerator divided by the denominator probably knew that just by saying it and percentage and we have learned that turning a decimal into a percent you multiply by 100 or you can move the gonna move that decimal twice to the right and end up at 30% so that is a 30% chance for the event to occur it is could happen though but unlikely all right the next example says suppose you spin the spinner which is divided into equal parts what is the probability that the pointer lands on a prime number so there are a few things we need to know here first of all we need to know a specific number how many times can that occur and do we even know what a of those thoughts right here all right setting up the question it says what is the probability of the spinner landing on a prime number what fraction and we have to determine what a prime number is well a prime number is a number that has factors of 1 and itself so only one in itself or all of the from the bottom and think about what 9 has in terms of factors well we have 1 multiplied by 9 that would make it prime could use to multiply to get 9 and that would be a 3 times a 3 so this one has three factors which automatically does not make it prime we call this composite alright the 8 has 1 and 8 1 times 8 is 8 and we also have some other factors called 2 and 4 so that is not prime we would call that composite alright think of 7 1 & 7 those are the only numbers that multiply together to get to 7 so we just going to roll through the rest of these real quick 6 is 1 2 3 & 6 composite 5 is 1 5 prime 4 is 1 2 & 4 composite prime and then these numbers up here at the top zero and one have a special rule these are neither so these are neither prime or composite so we leave those separate all right now now that I know what a prime number is I need to count up the number of outcomes that could showing up only one time each one zero one two three four five six seven eight have how many different equal pieces of pie one two three four five on the top six seven eight nine ten so we have another fraction broken into tenths and how many of them could occur well the prime numbers we have one two three four out of ten and we are going to need to reduce that fraction to what two fifths what is two-fifths equal to as a decimal well four tenths is read as four tenths that you can take the numerator four and divide it by the denominator and then the percentage move the decimal twice to year and we should end up at a 40% chance and if we were to go to the probability chart our job then is against it whatever the denominator is it happens to be a ten again I wish I you can change these fractions into fall so what did we say it was a 40% going to be closer to unlikely or equally likely and and that is going to be determined on where you place that fraction on your probability chart okay in your journal on page 2 of the flip chart write a few sentences on what you learned from this video and if you have any questions write those questions down bring them to class and we can answer them together

this lesson you will learn about probability now I want to talk about two different definitions here the first one is relative frequency now the relative frequency of an event is the number of times the event occurs per the number of attempts observed so relative frequency really depends on what happens during the trial if you did 20 coin tosses then the relative frequency would be a probability based off of the number of times you see the coin be head or tails that we can talk about in this case this is called theoretical probability now the theoretical probability of an event occurring is based on the context of the event and not the experiment or a number of trials for example you know that when heads and one side is tails so therefore you have a 50/50 chance of getting heads or tails when you do the actual trial maybe you get heads 20 20 frequency but theoretically heads should a problem together to understand the difference between these two types of probabilities Donna pulls cards from a deck she records whether the card she turns is red or black she then returns the card to the deck and shuffles the cards what is the relative frequency of picking a red card now remember the relative frequency is based off of the attempts that are observed right so total number of attempts which is 50 and we have the number of times that red or black appeared during those 50 trials frequency of choosing a red card right so this says that out of 50 attempts a red card appeared 20 times to find the division so 20 out of 50 trials proved for a red card now this simplifies to the fraction 2/5 2/5 is the same thing as the decimal 0.4 and if you convert this means that 2 out of every five times or 40% of the time the cards were read in her trial question here next we want to know what stick with picking a red card now remember theoretical probability has nothing to do with the attempts that are observed it has to do with the context of the situation now if you think about a deck of playing cards you can either have red or black half of the cards are red and half of the cards are black so that means the theoretical probability of pulling a red card is one in two or the fraction one-half and this can be simplified to 0.5 as a decimal or 50% so in theory if you do the picking of the cards right in theory 50% of the time you should get a red card and 50% of the time you should get a black card now notice here when we did the actual trial it turned out that 40% of the time the card was red whereas theoretically it should be 50% of the time now this is is involved during real-world events and this is why Donna did not pull a red card 50% of the time but rather 40% of the time as Donna continues to pull more cards though as the number of attempts or trials increases the relative frequency and the theoretical probability should get closer to one another and this is because as the sample size increases or the number of trials increases chance evens out and relative frequency should start to match up with the theoretical probability now a survey at our school about what students eat from the cafeteria fill in an experimental probability table based on the survey so below we can see how many students eat each type of food out of the 60 total students that she surveyed so this is a random sampling and we also need to keep in mind that the total school population is 1,200 first what I want to do is just find the relative frequency of the data here right so to do this convert each frequency into a decimal so what you 20 out of 50 20 out of 60 sorry preferred pizza if you simplify this fraction you can simplify it to the fraction one-third now one third we should convert to a decimal to find the relative frequency which ends up being zero point 3 3 3 3 3 or we could just keep it oops or we could just keep it to the hundredths thing here with the hotdogs right 10 out of 60 students prefer hotdogs when you simplify this fraction you get the fraction one sixth and this converts to the decimal zero point one six six six hundredths we get 0.16 or sorry zero point one seven okay now moving on we have mac and cheese 15 students out of sixty preferred mac and cheese and this can simplify to the fraction 1/4 which is the decimal 0.25 the last one we have 15 again so we out we can go all the way to 0.25 now what you can do is we have these gonna put that in one big table okay so that we had just done so we have the the probabilities or the relative frequencies of each type of food being table with these relative frequencies prediction the prediction I want to make is how many students eat macaroni and looking at the category of macaroni and cheese and we also need to keep in mind that the total school population is 1200 these relative frequencies came out of a smaller population right she only surveyed 60 students so what you can do is you can use this relative frequency right here to make a prediction about the entire population so what you want to do is multiply the relative frequency by the total population or what is 0.25 of 1,200 another way you can think about this is what is 25% of 1,200 or as a fraction 25% is 1/4 so what is 1/4 of 1,200 now 1/4 of 1,200 could be found by multiplying right so multiply the fraction by the whole number 1,200 you multiply 1,200 by the numerator and you get the

series on probability by talking about how we list possible outcomes for compound events just going over a basic overview listing means to actually have actually write them all out possible means what can actually happen and outcomes are just another word for results and compound events are our events where you have more than one event so if you have two events you have a compound event if you have three events you have a compound event because the definition of compound events is more than one event another way to think about it is two or more events okay all right let us move forward and talk about question asks us Elise is planning the menu for a dinner party and she wants to serve one main dish and one salad for the main dish she can make vegetable skewers pizza pasta or chicken for the salad Elise knows how to bake how to make potato salad or fruit salad make a tree diagram and list the possible outcomes below this is a classic example of a question you would get if you are having to be asked to list the possible outcomes for your compound events so asked if you had to answer a question about possible outcomes and listing them use a mathematical practice and make sense as we read this problem through all right Elise is planning the menu for a dinner party if you want to envision it you can think of a menu alright serve one main dish and one salad so we her salads okay for the main dish she can make vegetable skewers all right so I have of B she can make pizza represent that with a pea pasta if represented with the the next letter represented with an a p a pasta or chicken with a C for the now the salad for the salad at least the pee is over here as well alright make a tree diagram and list the outcomes below now going back here she wants to serve one main dish and one salad so what are the possible outcomes of this first you go to your main dish diagram go to your first event yeah so to speak your first event is main dishes how many outcomes do you have therefore list them on in your tree diagram so these letters stand for alright we go to step is to list the outcomes of the first event go to the next event how many outcomes do I have there there are each letter one two one two one two and outcomes below each potato salad and fruit salad potato salad fruit salad potato salad fruit salad potato salad fruit salad and you get the point all uh no more events that I have to deal possible outcomes and how we list our possible outcomes is we just take a look just connect the lines going straight down I saying hyphen every time that we pass through a branch on our tree diagram okay all right so our first outcome is going to be V hyphen PS next V hyphen F next p hyphen s sorry PS NP hyphen F and then our next outcome is a hyphen s PS a hyphen F and then at sea hyphen PS and then at sea hyphen F and either pick a vegetable skewer or potato salad I could pick a vegetable skewer or a fruit salad a pizza or potato salad pizza or fruit salad I could pick pasta or a potato salad and I could also pick see a stands for a stands for pasta yes I could lead to pick pasta or fruit salad or I could pick chicken with potato salad or chicken with fruit salad so those are my possible outcomes right there interestingly enough I hope you into this I have vpa c vp AC and then i also have psf psf psf psf psf all the way down okay and you should be able to to identify when you can make a new row to see the pattern or if you want you can list them vertically across here next problem all right Pamela is planning a vacation a mathematical practice is to make sense of the problem planning a vacation for each place another word for places location she can get there by taking a car or a bus alright so those are our modes of transportation I guess she can go to a city a river the ocean the mountains or a lake she picks one mode of transportation but transport tation and one location so these are the categories or the events that will be dealing with what are the different combinations that back to transportation those are the each place she can either get there by taking a car or a bus so a car or a bus right and then location can either be a city river ocean mountains and put MTX for short or a lake and I represent each of these by letters so we have a key pick I for city because i already use the c river ocean mountains lake all she can pick one mode of transportation so we list we look at our first event and we list the outcomes of only to then I look at the next event and I see how many there are 1 2 3 4 5 different branches below each letter list those outcomes and it is city river ocean mountains lake so I put I are 0 M L I are 0 m l and then I will actually list those outcomes by connecting the branches all right so i have seen hyphen I see hyphen R see hyphen o SI hyphen em c hyphen l now go the next would be hyphen I the hyphen R B hyphen o be list all the possible outcomes for those of you who are savvy and I starting to catch on here if you wanna if you want to check to see how many outcomes you should have see how many outcomes you have here I have two and the outcomes that I have for this are five if I take two times five that should give me ten different outcomes that I should have sense one two three four five six seven eight nine ten yes i have 10 events 10 outcomes therefore this is reasonable pattern works CB CB CB CB CB and I are 0 M L all right we have one more to go ready but I know you can handle it ',2184,4,1,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,Yes
